The commerically licensed packages are not distributed with public
versions of Dakota.  To use one of them with Dakota, obtain the source
code under an appropriate license and include it under the appropriate
packages directory when compiling Dakota.

Third-party system libraries: In addition to standard compiler and
system runtime libraries, Dakota uses the following external
third-party libraries for compilation and operation. These are
included in Dakota binary distributions (though not in source
distributions):

  BLAS/LAPACK	    BSD License, or that of compiler or system-provided libs
  Boost		    Boost Software License
  HDF5 (optional)   BSD-style Open Source License (variant)
    zlib            ZLib License

GPL/Other: Dakota may optionally depend on GNU GPL-licensed components, 
which are disabled by default, resulting in an LGPL-compatible Dakota.
Optional GPL capabilities include:

 * packages/external/hopspack/src/src-citizens/citizen-gss/cddlib/:
   enable with CMake setting HAVE_CDDLIB.

 * packages/external/fftw: optionally included with Dakota; enable 
   with CMake setting HAVE_FFTW

 * GNU Scientific Library: external third-party library; enable with
   CMake setting DAKOTA_HAVE_GSL and pointer to gsl-config

 * cURL/libcurl: external third-party library, MIT/modified-BSD
   license, but its dependencies have numerous licenses that make it
   challenging to redistribute.  Redistributed Dakota binaries never
   include libcurl.

Utilities required to compile and deploy Dakota and its documentation
are not included here.  These may include compilers, MPI, system
runtimes, Doxygen, LaTeX, Sphinx, CMake, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview

The Dakota toolkit provides a flexible, extensible interface between analysis 
codes and iteration methods. Dakota contains algorithms for optimization with 
gradient and nongradient-based methods; uncertainty quantification with 
sampling, reliability, stochastic expansion, and epistemic methods; parameter 
estimation with nonlinear least squares methods; and sensitivity/variance 
analysis with design of experiments and parameter study capabilities.  These 
capabilities may be used on their own or as components within advanced 
strategies such as surrogate-based optimization, mixed integer nonlinear 
programming, or optimization under uncertainty.

Refer to http://dakota.sandia.gov/ for additional information,
including support contacts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Distributions

Dakota is distributed in binary (executable/library) and source code
formats.  Recommendations for getting started with either format can
be found in INSTALL included with the distribution, but the most up to
date guidance can be found alongside downloads on the Dakota website.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Platforms

Dakota operates on most systems running Unix or Linux operating
systems as well as on Windows (with or without the help of a Cygwin
emulation layer).  Dakota is developed and most extensively tested on
Redhat Enterprise Linux with GNU compilers, but additional operating
systems / compiler combinations are regularly tested as well.  See the
Dakota website for more information on supported platforms for
particular Dakota versions.
