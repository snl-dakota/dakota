variables
  # The choice of variable categories and view is designed to check the
  # the ordering of correlation matrix output (labels and numerical results).
  # The response f should be highly correlated with x1, a bit correlated with x2,
  # and not correlated at all with x3. The expected label order in the console
  # output and hdf5 is "input spec" and therefore: x3, x1, x2, rather than 
  # cv, div, dsv, drv, which would be x1, x2, x3.
