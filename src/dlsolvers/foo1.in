# DAKOTA INPUT FILE : dakota_cantilever.in

# The cantilever test problem is primarily used in OUU testers.  This
# input file computes the deterministic solution to the cantilever
# problem when uncertainties are neglected.

# Each DAKOTA test file is capable of running multiple tests. The
# manual process for doing this is to add or uncomment specific lines
# needed for a test and comment out other lines which are not needed
# for that specific test.  Within the automatic test script, a special
# syntax is used to automatically determine which lines are to be used
# for a specific test. A #n (0 - 9) is used to associate lines in the
# test file with a specific test.  The #0 is used to designate lines
# which are to be run as part of the baseline test but not part of the
# other tests. To add multiple tests to a file add the #n to the
# trailing comment of a line, the dakota_test script will parse
# through the file uncommenting the lines marked for a specific test,
# and commenting out unneeded lines marked with the #0. Specific lines
# can be included in multiple tests by adding multiple #n designaters
# seperated by a comma.

# This tester populates a test matrix of NPSOL/DOT/CONMIN/OPT++ vs.
# dakota/vendor numerical gradients vs. forward/central differences.
