/// Class for the Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory methods within DAKOTA/UQ

/** The NonDEvidence class implements the propagation of epistemic uncertainty
    using Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. In this approach, one assigns 
    a set of basic probability assignments (BPA) to intervals defined 
    for the uncertain variables.  Input interval combinations are calculated,
    along with their BPA.  Currently, the response function is evaluated at 
    a set of sample points, then a response surface is constructed which is 
    sampled extensively to find the minimum and maximum within each input 
    interval cell, corresponding to the belief and plausibility within that 
    cell, respectively.  This data is then aggregated to calculate cumulative 
    distribution functions for belief and plausibility. */
