/** ********************************************************************

          AN IMPLEMENTATION OF A SEQUENTIAL QUADRATIC PROGRAMMING
           METHOD FOR SOLVING NONLINEAR OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS BY
            DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING AND NON-MONOTONE LINE SEARCH

    This subroutine solves the general nonlinear programming problem

              minimize    F(X)
              subject to  G(J,X)   =  0  ,  J=1,...,ME
                          G(J,X)  >=  0  ,  J=ME+1,...,M
                          XL  <=  X  <=  XU

    and is an extension of the code NLPQLD. NLPQLP is specifically
    tuned to run under distributed systems. A new input parameter L is
    introduced for the number of parallel computers, that is the number of
    function calls to be executed simultaneously. In case of L=1, NLPQLP
    is identical to NLPQLD. Otherwise the line search is modified to allow
    L parallel function calls in advance. Moreover the user has the
    opportunity to used distributed function calls for evaluating gradients.

    The algorithm is a modification of the method of Wilson, Han, and
    Powell. In each iteration step, a linearly constrained quadratic
    programming problem is formulated by approximating the Lagrangian
    function quadratically and by linearizing the constraints.
    Subsequently, a one-dimensional line search is performed with
    respect to an augmented Lagrangian merit function to obtain
    a new iterate. Also the modified line search algorithm guarantees
    convergence under the same assumptions as before.

    For the new version, a non-monotone line search is implemented which 
    allows to increase the merit function in case of instabilities, for 
    example caused by round-off errors, errors in gradient approximations,
    etc.

    The subroutine contains the option to predetermine initial
    guesses for the multipliers or the Hessian of the Lagrangian
    function and is called by reverse communication.
