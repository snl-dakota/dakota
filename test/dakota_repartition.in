# DAKOTA INPUT FILE - dakota_repartition.in

# A two-pass parameter study with repartitioning of multiprocessor
# analysis server size.  Method 1 uses 2 processors per analysis, and
# method 2 repartitions to 5 processors per analysis.  A minimum of 5
# processors is required to run this input file, which will result in
# a dedicated master/self-scheduling approach for method 1 (9 jobs
# through 2 2-proc. servers) and a peer/static scheduling approach for
# method 2 (44 jobs through 1 5-proc. server).  11 processors is also
# a good choice (5 2-proc. servers and 2 5-proc. servers with
# dedicated- master/self-scheduling for both methods).
