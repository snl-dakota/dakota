# DAKOTA INPUT FILE - dakota_repartition.in

# A two-pass parameter study with repartitioning of multiprocessor
# analysis server size.  Method 1 uses 2 processors per analysis, and
# method 2 repartitions to 5 processors per analysis.  A minimum of 5
# processors is required to run this input file, which will result in
# a dedicated scheduler approach for method 1 (9 jobs through 2 2-proc.
# servers) and a peer/static scheduling approach for method 2 (44 jobs
# through 1 5-proc. server).  11 processors is also a good choice
# (5 2-proc. servers and 2 5-proc. servers with a dedicated scheduler
# for both methods).
