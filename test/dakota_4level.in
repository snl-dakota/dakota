# This tester has been used to measure scaling performance in 4 level
# parallel executions on ASCI Red.  It employs a multi-start environment with
# vector parameter studies and the concurrency per level has been carefully
# selected to be evenly divisible by the number of servers.  These studies
# employed 384 processors in a variety of server configurations, e.g. an
# 8/8/3/2 configuration as indicated in the comments.
