# Solve the AMPL diet1 problem: minimize cost subject to buying at
# least one entree, side, and drink.  The optimal objective is 2.81.
#
# The AMPL model files are generated from pyomo:
#   pyomo diet1.py diet.dat --save-model dakota_ampl_diet.nl --symbolic-solver-labels
#
# This test is protecting parsing of AMPL labels with spaces and AMPL
# responses that are ordered differently than the Dakota reponses.
#
# Technically the decision variables are discrete, but the SQP finds
# the correct solution on the bounds of the domain
