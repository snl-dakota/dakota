# Tests: all use workdir named trydir
# 0	no extra options (script in inputdir, tmpnamed files)
# 1	tag the workdir
# 2	tag and save the workdir
# 3	template_files linked from trydir (check data file existence)
# 4	template_directory contents linked from trydir
# 5	template_files copied from trydir
# 6	template_directory contents copied from trydir
# 7	analysis driver located in template_directory
# 8	basic work_directory, but with named parameters file, stripping dirname
# 9	tagged and saved work_directory, with named and saved parameters file

# Inactive tests
# 10     test using environment variables to communicate the file names

# TODO: Add tests for:
# * driver lives on PATH, but not in inputdir
# * driver is a template file (not sure how to test since . should be a valid 
#   location)
# * named vs. anonymous work_directory
# * put a junk file and use replace to replace
# * put a good file and verify junk doesn't replace
# * asynch vs. synch
# * Test with trydir/subdir for workdir (currently requires mkdir trydir first)
# * Get autotagging working and test
# * Parallel testing: blocked for test > 1 as doesn't seem to find driver in pwd
