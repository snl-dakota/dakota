# DAKOTA INPUT FILE - dakota_sbo_hierarchical.in

# Demonstrates the use of hierarchical approximations and a trust
# region optimization environment in minimizing Rosenbrock's function.

# Each DAKOTA test file is capable of running multiple tests. The
# manual process for doing this is to add or uncomment specific lines
# needed for a test and comment out other lines which are not needed
# for that specific test.  Within the automatic test script, a special
# syntax is used to automatically determine which lines are to be used
# for a specific test. A #n (0 - 9) is used to associate lines in the
# test file with a specific test.  The #s0 is used to designate lines
# which are to be run as part of the baseline test but not part of the
# other tests. To add multiple tests to a file add the #n to the
# trailing comment of a line, the dakota_test script will parse
# through the file uncommenting the lines marked for a specific test,
# and commenting out unneeded lines marked with the #s0. Specific lines
# can be included in multiple tests by adding multiple #n designaters
# seperated by a comma.

# These tests exercise each of the surrogate correction approaches
# (additive and multiplicative; zeroth, first, and second order) for
# the multifidelity (i.e., hierarchical) variant of surrogate-based
# optimization.  Note that correction is required for hierarchical SBO.
