"""Manage evaluation tiling on SLURM+OpenMPI HPCs that lack srun.

This module provides support for tiling multiprocessor simulation runs in a
job allocation. As much information as possible is collected from SLURM
environment variables, including the number of nodes and processes per node.
(The terms processses and tasks are used interchangably.)

Static and dynamic scheduling are supported. Under a static scheduling model,
the launching function tiling_run_static should be used, and for dynamic, 
tiling_run_dynamic. In static scheduling, tile availability is determined using
the Dakota evaluation number, which must be provided by the user. Dynamic
scheduling makes use of named pipes (FIFOs), which can be created atomically.
The pipes are used only as tokens to represent in-use tiles. Nothing is written 
or read from them. This approach eliminates the need for pre-generating a set of 
machine files. By default, named pipes are created in $HOME/.DakotaEvalTiling,
but the location (and pipe names) is customizable.

Other module features:
  * Dedicated Dakota node. When enabled, the first node is reserved for running
    Dakota and the user's analysis drivers, which may be desireable when the 
    user's simulations are memory intensive.
  * MIMD model. The launcher functions expect a list of commands along with the
    number of processes for each.
  * Optionally specify the tile size to enable running on a subset of a tile
  * Extra keyword arguments to tile_run_{dynamic,static} are passed down to
    the Popen instance that invokes mpirun, permitting the client to provide
    stdout/stderr/stdin streams, specify a cwd, etc. (By default, stdout,
    stderr, and stdin are attached to sys.stdout, sys.stderr, and sys.stdin).

Example Usage::

    from dakota.interfacing import parallel, read_parameters_file

    # Dynamic scheduling. On 4 processs, launch "my_sim" with the --verbose
    # option. Pass the "--bind-to none" option ot mpirun by including it
    # before the user's executable and its options.

    my_command = (4, ["--bind-to", "none", "my_sim", "--verbose"])
    parallel.tile_run_dynamic(commands=[my_command])

    # Static scheduling, same command. However, the eval number is needed.
    # Assumption: This script was forked by Dakota as analysis_driver,
    # and therefore read_parameters_file can acquire the names of the params
    # and results files from the command line arguments.

    params, results = read_parameters_file()
    parallel.tile_run_static(commands=[my_command], eval_num=params.eval_num)

    # MIMD model: mpirun -np 16 my_sim1 : -np 16 my_sim2

    my_commands = [ (16, ["my_sim1"]),
                 (16, ["my_sim2"])]
    parallel.tile_run_dynamic(commands=my_commands)
