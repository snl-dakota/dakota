- Plotly Plotting Integration. The GUI now integrates the Plotly plotting library. You can perform basic scatter plots, histograms, and box-and-whisker plots against Dakota tabular output data.
- Input specification ordering. Reorder and clean up interface, environment, and model blocks to follow more natural ordering and support GUI integration.
- Reordering of Dakota Example Inputs. Several of Dakota's shipped example input files have been reordered to work out-of-the-box in the GUI.
- NIDR Parser Utilities. Developer productivity: NIDR utilities built on all platforms to allow fewer NIDR-generated files in repository and input file reordering in GUI
- Use of examples in GUI. Examples from training, users, and advanced directories are now ordered and debugged to work in GUI
