# Last tested 131122 - Dakota 5.4
# usage
# dakota dakota_Ponly_calibration.in &> dakota.out

# this runs a gradient based optimization, which is formulated
# to minimize residual values
# Dakota will run the analysis driver, and get a results file
# with 24 responses. It then subtracts the 24 terms in the
# calibration_data_file, and then minimizes the residuals 
# simultaneously.
# after this runs, you can read the results in dakota.out, or
# analyze the tabular data
