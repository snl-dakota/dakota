This directory contains all the code for running the Tank problem,
used in the 2014 V&V Challenge Workshop at the ASME V&V Symposium.

There are usage notes within the individual files. More details and
the context of the workshop are available online at: https://share.sandia.gov/vvcw
This site will continue to operate until at least FY15.

In summary, FEMTank.py is a proxy for a finite element code that 
computes Tank response to loading. EvalTank.py is a driver script
that Dakota uses to interface with FEMTank.py.

To test that the code is running properly, type
  python EvalTank.py SampleInputToEvalTankpy SampleSummaryFile SampleDataFile
or
  EvalTank.py SampleInputToEvalTankpy SampleSummaryFile SampleDataFile
The second option requires that EvalTank.py be executable.

A matlab script is also provided to visualize the Tank walls.
