#  DAKOTA INPUT FILE - dakota_rosenbrock.in
#  This sample Dakota input file optimizes the Rosenbrock function.
#  See p. 95 in Practical Optimization by Gill, Murray, and Wright.

# This input file works with dakota.exe built with MinGW.
# It also works with dakota.exe built with cygwin if you copy or move
# renenbrock.exe and simulator_script.bat to templatedir .
