# Demonstrates the use of the multi_start environment for a
# multimodal test problem.  The global optimum is at the
# point (x1,x2) = (0.177,0.177) which has a function value
# of 0.060.

# Parallel test matrix is dedicated master and peer partition
# scheduling for concurrent iterators with single-processor and
# multiprocessor iterator partitions. Parallel tests 2 and 3 include
# an idle partition due to over-allocation
