% to embed the Manual, but cannot currently preserve the original hyperlinking.
% Therefore, it is currently restricted to report printing, and should not be
% used for electronic documents.

% Rather than adopting the SAND report class for the entire manual, we include
% the doxygen-generated Dev Manual within a SAND report shell.  The first two
% pages of refman.pdf have their own title page, such that the document can
% stand alone.  For SAND report preparation, we omit the first two pages by
% including 3-end.  The page numbering matches up since we set the page counter
% to 3 for the title page in header-dev.tex.
