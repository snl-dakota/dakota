\section StyleConventionsIntro Introduction


Common code development practices can be extremely useful in multiple
developer environments.  Particular styles for code components lead to
improved readability of the code and can provide important visual cues
to other developers.  Much of this recommended practices document is
borrowed from the CUBIT mesh generation project, which in turn borrows
its recommended practices from other projects, yielding some
consistency across Sandia projects.  While not strict requirements,
these guidelines suggest a best-practices starting point for coding in
%Dakota.


\section StyleConventionsCpp C++/c Style Guidelines


Style guidelines involve the ability to discern at a glance the type
and scope of a variable or function.


\subsection StyleConventionsCV Class and variable styles

Class names should be composed of two or more descriptive words, with
the first character of each word capitalized, e.g.:
\code
class ClassName;
\endcode

Class member variables should be composed of two or more descriptive
words, with the first character of the second and succeeding words
capitalized, e.g.:
\code
double classMemberVariable;
\endcode

Temporary (i.e. local) variables are lower case, with underscores
separating words in a multiple word temporary variable, e.g.:
\code
int temporary_variable;
\endcode

Constants (i.e. parameters) and enumeration values are upper case, 
with underscores separating words, e.g.:
\code
const double CONSTANT_VALUE;
\endcode


\subsection StyleConventionsFn Function styles

Function names are lower case, with underscores separating words, e.g.:
\code
int function_name();
\endcode
There is no need to distinguish between member and non-member
functions by style, as this distinction is usually clear by context.
This style convention allows member function names which set and
return the value of a similarly-named private member variable, e.g.:
\code
int memberVariable;
void member_variable(int a) { // set
  memberVariable = a;
}
int member_variable() const { // get
  return memberVariable;
}
\endcode

In cases where the data to be set or returned is more than a few bytes,
it is highly desirable to employ const references to avoid unnecessary 
copying, e.g.:
\code
void continuous_variables(const RealVector& c_vars) { // set
  continuousVariables = c_vars;
}
const RealVector& continuous_variables() const {      // get
  return continuousVariables;
}
\endcode

Note that it is not necessary to always accept the returned data as a
const reference.  If it is desired to be able change this data, then
accepting the result as a new variable will generate a copy, e.g.:
\code
// reference to continuousVariables cannot be changed
const RealVector& c_vars = model.continuous_variables();
// local copy of continuousVariables can be changed
RealVector c_vars = model.continuous_variables();
\endcode


\subsection StyleConventionsMisc Miscellaneous

Appearance of typedefs to redefine or alias basic types is isolated to
a few header files (\c data_types.h, \c template_defs.h), so that
issues like program precision can be changed by changing a few lines
of typedefs rather than many lines of code, e.g.:
\code
typedef double Real;
\endcode

\c xemacs is the preferred source code editor, as it has C++ modes for
enhancing readability through color (turn on "Syntax highlighting").
Other helpful features include "Paren highlighting" for matching
parentheses and the "New Frame" utility to have more than one window
operating on the same set of files (note that this is still the same
edit session, so all windows are synchronized with each other).
Window width should be set to 80 internal columns, which can be
accomplished by manual resizing, or preferably, using the following
alias in your shell resource file (e.g., \c .cshrc):
\verbatim
alias xemacs "xemacs -g 81x63"
\endverbatim
where an external width of 81 gives 80 columns internal to the window
and the desired height of the window will vary depending on monitor
size.  This window width imposes a coding standard since you should
avoid line wrapping by continuing anything over 80 columns onto the
next line.

Indenting increments are 2 spaces per indent and comments are
aligned with the code they describe, e.g.:
\code
void abort_handler(int code)
{
  int initialized = 0;
  MPI_Initialized(&initialized);
  if (initialized) {
    // comment aligned to block it describes
    int size;
    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);
    if (size>1)
      MPI_Abort(MPI_COMM_WORLD, code);
    else
      exit(code);
  }
  else
    exit(code);
}
\endcode

Also, the continuation of a long command is indented 2 spaces, e.g.:
\code
  const String& iterator_scheduling
    = problem_db.get_string("strategy.iterator_scheduling");
\endcode

and similar lines are aligned for readability, e.g.:
\code
  cout << "Numerical gradients using " << finiteDiffStepSize*100. << "%"
       << finiteDiffType << " differences\nto be calculated by the "
       << methodSource << " finite difference routine." << endl;
\endcode

Lastly, \#ifdef's are not indented (to make use of syntax highlighting
in xemacs).


\section StyleConventionsFile File Naming Conventions


In addition to the style outlined above, the following file naming
conventions have been established for the %Dakota project.

File names for C++ classes should, in general, use the same name as
the class defined by the file.  Exceptions include: 
<ul>
<li> with the introduction of the Dakota namespace, base classes which
previously utilized prepended %Dakota identifiers can now safely omit
the identifiers.  However, since file names do not have namespace
protection from name collisions, they retain the prepended %Dakota
identifier.  For example, a class previously named DakotaModel which
resided in DakotaModel.cpp/hpp, is now Dakota::Model (class Model in
namespace %Dakota) residing in the same filenames.  The retention of
the previous filenames reduces the possibility of multiple instances
of a Model.hpp causing problems.  Derived classes (e.g., NestedModel) do
not require a prepended %Dakota identifier for either the class or file
names.
<li> in a few cases, it is convenient to maintain several closely
related classes in a single file, in which case the file name may
reflect the top level class or some generalization of the set of
classes (e.g., DakotaResponse.[CH] files contain Dakota::Response and
Dakota::ResponseRep classes, and DakotaBinStream.[CH] files contain 
the Dakota::BiStream and Dakota::BoStream classes).
</ul>

The type of file is determined by one of the four file name extensions
listed below:
<ul>
<li> <b>.hpp</b> A class header file ends in the suffix .hpp. The header
file provides the class declaration. This file does not contain code
for implementing the methods, except for the case of inline
functions. Inline functions are to be placed at the bottom of the file
with the keyword inline preceding the function name.

<li> <b>.cpp</b> A class implementation file ends in the suffix .cpp. An
implementation file contains the definitions of the members of the
class.

<li> <b>.h</b> A header file ends in the suffix .h. The header file
contains information usually associated with procedures. Defined
constants, data structures and function prototypes are typical
elements of this file.

<li> <b>.c</b> A procedure file ends in the suffix .c. The procedure
file contains the actual procedures.
</ul>


\section StyleConventionsDox Class Documentation Conventions


Class documentation uses the doxygen tool available from
http://www.doxygen.org and employs the JAVA-doc comment style.  Brief
comments appear in header files next to the attribute or function
declaration.  Detailed descriptions for functions should appear
alongside their implementations (i.e., in the .cpp files for
non-inlined, or in the headers next to the function definition for
inlined).  Detailed comments for a class or a class attribute must go
in the header file as this is the only option.

NOTE: Previous class documentation utilities (class2frame and class2html)
used the "//-" comment style and comment blocks such as this:
\code
//- Class:       Model
//- Description: The model to be iterated by the Iterator.  
//-              Contains Variables, Interface, and Response objects.
//- Owner:       Mike Eldred
//- Version: $Id: Dev_Recomm_Pract.dox 4549 2007-09-20 18:25:03Z mseldre $
\endcode

These tools are no longer used, so remaining comment blocks of this
type are informational only and will not appear in the documentation
generated by doxygen.

\section StyleConventionsCMake CMake Style Guidelines

%Dakota conventions for CMake files, such as CMakeLists.txt,
FooConfig.cmake, etc., follow.  Our goal is ease of reading,
maintenance, and support, similar to the C++ code itself.  Current
CMake versions and build hints are maintained at the Developer Portal
http://dakota.sandia.gov/developer/.

\subsection StyleConventionsCMakeFormat CMake Code Formatting

<ul>
  <li>Indentation is 2 spaces, consistent with %Dakota C++ style.</li>
  <li>Lines should be kept to less than 80 chars per line
      where possible.</li>
  <li>Wrapped lines may be indented two spaces or aligned with prior
      lines.</li>
  <li>For ease of viewing and correctness checking in Emacs, a
      customization file is available:
      http://www.cmake.org/CMakeDocs/cmake-mode.el</li>
</ul>

\subsection StyleConventionsCMakeVars CMake Variable Naming Conventions 

These variable naming conventions are especially important for those
that ultimately become preprocessor defines and affect compilation of
source files.

<ul>
  <li>Classic/core elements of the CMake language are set in
      lower_case, e.g., option, set, if, find_library.</li>
  <li>Static arguments to CMake functions and macros are set in
      UPPER_CASE, e.g. REQUIRED, NO_MODULE, QUIET.</li>
  <li>Minimize "global" variables, i.e., don't use 2 variables with
      the same meaning when one will do the job.</li>
  <li>Feature toggling: when possible, use the "HAVE_<pkg/feature>"
      convention already in use by many CMake-enabled TPLs, e.g.,
\code
$ grep HAVE_SYSTEM Dakota/src/CMakeLists.txt

check_function_exists(system HAVE_SYSTEM)
if(HAVE_SYSTEM)
  add_definitions("-DHAVE_SYSTEM")
endif(HAVE_SYSTEM)

$ grep HAVE_CONMIN Dakota/src/CMakeLists.txt Dakota/packages/CMakeLists.txt
Dakota/src/CMakeLists.txt:if(HAVE_CONMIN)
Dakota/src/CMakeLists.txt:endif(HAVE_CONMIN)
Dakota/packages/CMakeLists.txt:option(HAVE_CONMIN "Build the CONMIN package." ON)
Dakota/packages/CMakeLists.txt:if(HAVE_CONMIN)
Dakota/packages/CMakeLists.txt:endif(HAVE_CONMIN)
\endcode

</li>

  <li>When a variable/preprocessor macro could result in name clashes
      beyond %Dakota scope, e.g., for library_mode users, consider
      prefixing the "HAVE_<pkg>" name with DAKOTA_, e.g. DAKOTA_HAVE_MPI.
      Currently, MPI is the only use case for such a variable
      in %Dakota, but many examples can be found in the CMake Modules
      source, e.g.
\code
grep _HAVE_ <cmake_prefix_dir>/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/*
\endcode
  </li>

</ul>
