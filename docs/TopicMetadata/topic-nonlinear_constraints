Nonlinear constraints are supported by many of Dakota's optimizers. For a 
discussion of the difference between nonlinear and linear constraints,
see the \ref topic-linear_constraints topic page. The Constraint Considerations
section of the \ref topic-optimization_and_calibration page may also be of interest.
