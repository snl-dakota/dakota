The HOPSPACK software 
\cite Plantenga2009 contains the 
asynchronous parallel pattern search (APPS) algorithm 
\cite GrKo06. It can handle unconstrained
problems as well as those with bound constraints, linear constraints,
and general nonlinear constraints. 

HOPSPACK is available to the
public under the GNU LGPL and the source code is included with %Dakota.
HOPSPACK-specific software documentation is available from
https://software.sandia.gov/trac/hopspack.
