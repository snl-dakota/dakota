The NLPQL library includes a sequential quadratic programming (SQP)
optimizer, specified as %Dakota's \c nlpql_sqp method, for constrained
optimization. The particular implementation used is NLPQLP \cite Sch04,
a variant with distributed and non-monotone line search.  NLPQL
is commercially licensed (available from the author) and not
distributed with public versions of Dakota.
