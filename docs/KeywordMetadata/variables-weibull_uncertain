Aleatory uncertain variable - Weibull
Description::
The Weibull distribution is also referred to as the Type III Smallest Extreme Value distribution.
The Weibull distribution is commonly used in reliability studies to predict the lifetime of a device.  It is also used to model capacity variables such as material strength.

The density function for the Weibull distribution is given by: 
\f[f(x) = \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)^{\alpha-1} e^{-\left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)^{\alpha}}\f]
where \f$\mu_W = \beta \Gamma(1+\frac{1}{\alpha})\f$ and 
\f$\sigma_W = \sqrt{\frac{\Gamma(1+\frac{2}{\alpha})}{\Gamma^2(1+\frac{1}{\alpha})} - 1} \mu_W\f$
