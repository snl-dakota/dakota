Launch analysis drivers using fork command
Description::
The fork interface is the most common means by which %Dakota launches a
separate application analysis process.

The fork interface is recommended for most analysis drivers that are
external to Dakota (i.e. not using the \c direct interface).

As explained in the Users Manual, the parameters
and results file names are passed on the command line to the analysis
driver(s).
If specified input/output filters are specified, those will be run
before/after the analysis drivers.
The \c verbatim keyword is used to modify the default driver/filter commands.

For additional information on invocation syntax, see the Interfaces
chapter of the Users Manual [\cite UsersMan "Adams et al., 2010"]. 

<!---- The \c fork keyword anchors
the group specification and the \c parameters_file, \c results_file,
\c verbatim, \c aprepro, \c file_tag, and \c file_save are additional
settings within the group specification. 

The parameters and results
file names are supplied as strings using the \c parameters_file and \c
results_file specifications. Both specifications are optional with the
default data transfer files being Unix temporary files with
system-generated names (e.g., \c /usr/tmp/aaaa08861). 

File
tagging (appending parameters and results files with the function
evaluation number) and file saving (leaving parameters and results
files in existence after their use is complete) are controlled with
the \c file_tag and \c file_save flags. If these specifications are
omitted, the default is no file tagging (no appended function
evaluation number) and no file saving (files will be removed after a
function evaluation). File tagging is most useful when multiple
function evaluations are running simultaneously using files in a
shared disk space, and file saving is most useful when debugging the
data communication between %Dakota and the simulation.
