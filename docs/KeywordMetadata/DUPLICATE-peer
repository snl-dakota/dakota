Specify a peer partition for parallel iterator scheduling
Description::
This option overrides the Dakota parallel automatic configuration, forcing 
the use of a peer partition. In a peer partition, all processors are
available to be assigned to iterator servers. Note that unlike 
the case of \c evaluation_scheduling, it is not possible to specify \c static 
or \c dynamic.
