Blurb::
Samples variables as a specified values

Description::
%Dakota's list parameter study allows for evaluations at user selected
points of interest.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

By default, the list parameter study operates over all types of
variables.

The number of real values in the \c list_of_points specification or
file referenced by \c import_points_file must be a multiple of the
total number of variables (including continuous and discrete types)
contained in the variables specification. 

<b> Expected Outputs </b>

A list parameter study produces a set of responses for each parameter
set that is specified.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

\li This parameter study simply
  performs simulations for the first parameter set (the first \c n
  entries in the list), followed by the next parameter set (the next \c
  n entries), and so on, until the list of points has been
  exhausted. 
\li Since the initial values from the variables specification
  will not be used, they need not be specified.
\li When the points are specified in the %Dakota input file using the
   \c list_of_points keyword, discrete set values must be referred to using 0-based
  indexes, and not the values themselves. However, when using \c import_points_file,
  refer to discrete set values directly, not by index.
\li For both \c list_of_points and \c import_points_file, %Dakota expects the values
  for each evaluation to be ordered by type. The type ordering matches that of the
  \ref variables section of this Reference Manual and of the listing in the Parameters 
   file format section of the %Dakota User's Manual \cite UsersMan. When multiple 
  variables are present for a single type, the ordering within that type must match 
  the order specified by the user in the variables section of her input file.

Examples::
This shows the method and variables block of a %Dakota input file
that runs a list_parameter_study.
\verbatim
method
  list_parameter_study
    list_of_points =
                 3.1e6    0.0029    0.31  
                 3.2e6    0.0028    0.32 
                 3.3e6    0.0027    0.34 
                 3.3e6    0.0026    0.36  

variables
  continuous_design = 3
    descriptors = 'E'    'MASS'     'DENSITY'

\endverbatim

Note that because of the way %Dakota treats whitespace, the above example is equivalent to:
\verbatim
method
  list_parameter_study
    list_of_points =
3.1e6    0.0029    0.31  3.2e6    0.0028    
0.32    3.3e6    0.0027    
0.34  3.3e6    0.0026    0.36

variables
  continuous_design = 3
    descriptors = 'E'  'MASS'   'DENSITY'
\endverbatim
Although the first example is much more readable.

And here's a full input file:

\verbatim
# tested on Dakota 6.0 on 140501
environment
  tabular_data
    tabular_data_file 'List_param_study.dat'

method
  list_parameter_study
    list_of_points =     0.1    0.1
                         0.2    0.1
                         0.3    0.0
                         0.3    1.0

model
  single

variables
  active design
  continuous_design = 2
    descriptors    'x1' 'x2'
  continuous_state = 1
    descriptors =   'constant1'
    initial_state = 100

interface
  analysis_drivers 'text_book'
    fork
  asynchronous
    evaluation_concurrency 2

responses
  response_functions = 1
  no_gradients
  no_hessians

\endverbatim

This example illustrates the list_parameter_study.

\li The function evaluations are independent, so any level of 
    \c evaluation_concurrency can be used
\li Default behavior for parameter studies is to iterate on all variables. 
    However, because \c active \c design is specified, this study will only 
    iterate on the \c continuous_design variables.
