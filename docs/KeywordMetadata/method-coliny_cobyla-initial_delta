Reasonable initial changes to optimization variables

Description::
\c initial_delta for COBYLA should be set to be a value that is
reasonable for initial changes to the optimization variables.  It
represents a distance from the initial simplex within which linear
approximation subproblems can be trusted to be sufficiently
representative of the true problem.  It is analagous to the initial
trust-region size used in trust-region methods.


<b> Default Behavior </b>

The default value is 1.0.
