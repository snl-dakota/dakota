Blurb::
Augment an existing LHS study
Description::
\c incremental_lhs will augment an existing LHS sampling study with more
samples to get better estimates of mean, variance, and percentiles.

The number of samples in the second
set MUST currently be 2 times the number of previous samples, although
incremental sampling based on any power of two may be supported in
future releases.

To use this \c sample_type, a previous LHS (or incremental LHS)
sampling study with sample size
\f$ N \f$ must have already been performed, and
<b> the dakota restart file must be available from this previous study. </b>
The variables and 
responses specifications must be the same in both studies.

See the examples below and 
the \ref running_dakota-usage and \ref dakota_restart pages.

Examples::
For example, say a user performs
an initial study using \c lhs as the \c sample_type, and generates 10
samples.

One way to ensure the restart file is saved is to specify a non-default name,
via a command line option:
\verbatim 
dakota -i LHS_10.in -w LHS_10.rst
\endverbatim

which uses the input file:

\verbatim 
# LHS_10.in

environment
  tabular_graphics_data
    tabular_graphics_file = 'lhs10.dat'

method
  sampling
    sample_type lhs
    samples = 10

model
  single

variables
  uniform_uncertain = 2
    descriptors  =   'input1'     'input2'
    lower_bounds =  -2.0     -2.0
    upper_bounds =   2.0      2.0

interface
  analysis_drivers 'text_book'
    fork

responses
  response_functions = 1
  no_gradients
  no_hessians
\endverbatim
and the restart file is written to LHS_10.rst.


Then an incremental LHS study can be run with:
\verbatim 
dakota -i LHS_20.in -r LHS_10.rst -w LHS_20.rst
\endverbatim
where \c LHS_20.in is shown below, and LHS_10.rst is the restart
file containing the results of the previous LHS study.
\verbatim 
# LHS_20.in

environment
  tabular_graphics_data
    tabular_graphics_file = 'lhs_incremental_20.dat'

method
  sampling
    sample_type incremental_lhs
    samples = 20
    previous_samples = 10

model
  single

variables
  uniform_uncertain = 2
    descriptors  =   'input1'     'input2'
    lower_bounds =  -2.0     -2.0
    upper_bounds =   2.0      2.0

interface
  analysis_drivers 'text_book'
    fork

responses
  response_functions = 1
  no_gradients
  no_hessians
\endverbatim

The user will get 10 new LHS samples which
maintain both the correlation and stratification of the original LHS
sample. The new samples will be combined with the original
samples to generate a combined sample of size 20.

This is clearly seen by comparing the two tabular graphics data files.
