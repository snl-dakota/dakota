Determine how Dakota responds to analysis driver failure

Description::
Dakota can deal with analysis failure in a few ways.

The first step is that Dakota must detect analysis
failure. Importantly, Dakota always expects a results file to be
written by the analysis driver, even when a failure has occurred. If
the file does not exist when the analysis driver exits, a Dakota error
results, causing Dakota itself to terminate. The analysis driver
communicates an analysis failure to Dakota by writing a results file
beginning with the (case-insensitive) word "fail".  Any file contents
after "fail" are ignored.

Once Dakota detects analysis failure, the failure can be mitigated in four ways:
- \ref interface-analysis_drivers-failure_capture-abort (the default)
- \ref interface-analysis_drivers-failure_capture-retry
- \ref interface-analysis_drivers-failure_capture-recover
- \ref interface-analysis_drivers-failure_capture-continuation

<!-- If no failure -->
<!-- capturing specification is provided, then the default behavior is -->
<!-- method dependent. For those iterative algorithms that provide -->
<!-- internal failure mitigation strategies (currently NL2SOL and MOOCHO), -->
<!-- the default is to transfer the failure information from the interface -->
<!-- back to the algorithm for mitigation, with no specific action taken by -->
<!-- %Dakota. For all other algorithms, the default is to abort. -->
