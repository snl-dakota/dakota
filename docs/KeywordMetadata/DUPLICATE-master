Specify a dedicated master partition for parallel iterator scheduling
Description::
This option overrides the Dakota parallel automatic configuration, forcing 
the use of a dedicated master partition. In a dedicated master partition, 
one processor (the "master") dynamically schedules work on the iterator 
servers. This reduces the number of processors available to create servers 
by 1.
