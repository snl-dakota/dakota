Output central moments and include them within the set of final statistics.
Description::
Output central moments (mean, variance, 3rd central, and 4th central) and include the first two within the set of final statistics to be used at a higher level (e.g., optimization under uncertainty, mixed aleatory-epistemic UQ).  This inclusion of moment results affects the primary and/or secondary response mappings in a nested model specificaton.

Examples::
The following method specification overrides the default to print ``central`` moments and include them in the set of final statistics.
