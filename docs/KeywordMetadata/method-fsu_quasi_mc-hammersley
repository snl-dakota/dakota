Use Hammersley sequences
Description::
The Hammersley sequence is the same as the Halton sequence, except the values
for the first random variable are equal to 1/N, where N is the number of
samples. Thus, if one wants to generate a sample set of 100 samples for 3
random variables, the first random variable has values 1/100, 2/100, 3/100,
etc. and the second and third variables are generated according to a Halton
sequence with bases 2 and 3, respectively.
