Use the best designs to form a new population
Description::
The ``elitist`` (default) setting creates a new population using (a)
the ``replacement_size`` best individuals from the current population,
(b) and ``population_size`` - ``replacement_size`` individuals randomly
selected from the newly generated individuals.  It is possible in this
case to lose a good solution from the newly generated individuals if
it is not randomly selected for replacement; however, the default
``new_solutions_generated`` value is set such that the entire set of newly
generated individuals will be selected for replacement.
