Blurb::
Requires correct function value labels in results file
Description::
The \c labeled keyword directs %Dakota to enforce a stricter results file 
format and enables more detailed error reporting.

When the \c labeled keyword is used, function values in results
files must be accompanied by their corresponding descriptors. If the 
user did not supply response \ref responses-descriptors in her %Dakota 
input file, then %Dakota auto-generated descriptors are expected.

Distinct error messages are emitted for function values that are out-of-order,
repeated, or missing. Labels that appear without a function value and unexpected data 
are also reported as errors. %Dakota attempts to report all errors in a results
file, not just the first it encounters. After reporting results file errors, %Dakota
aborts.

Labels for analytic gradients and Hessians currently are not supported.

Although the \c labeled keyword is optional, its use is recommended to help catch
and identify problems with results files. The User's Manual contains further information 
about the results file format.

<b> Default Behavior </b>
<p> By default, %Dakota does not require labels for function values, and
ignores them if they are present.</p>
