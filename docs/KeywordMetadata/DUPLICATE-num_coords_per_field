Number of independent coordinates for field responses
Description::
This keyword describes the number of independent coordinates for each field response. 
It is an integer vector of length \c field_responses.
For example, if the \c field_responses = 2, an example would be 
\c num_coordinates_per_field = 2 1 means that the first field response has two sets of independent coordinates 
(perhaps x, y locations), but the second response only has one (for example, time where the field response 
is only dependent upon time). 
The actual coordinate values (e.g. the independent variables) corresponding to these field 
responses are defined in a file call response_descriptor.coords, 
where response_descriptor is the name of the individual field.
