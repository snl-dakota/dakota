Simple greedy local search method
Description::
The Solis-Wets method is a simple greedy local search heuristic for
continuous parameter spaces. Solis-Wets generates trial points using a
multivariate normal distribution, and unsuccessful trial points are
reflected about the current point to find a descent direction.

<b> See the page \ref topic-package_scolib for important information
regarding all SCOLIB methods </b>

\c coliny_solis_wets is inherently serial, no concurrency is used.

These specifications have the same meaning as corresponding
specifications for \ref method-coliny_pattern_search. Please see that
page for specification details.

In particular, \c coliny_solis_wets supports dynamic rescaling of the
step length, and dynamic rescaling of the constraint penalty. The only
new specification is \c contract_after_failure, which specifies the
number of unsuccessful cycles which must occur with a specific delta
prior to contraction of the delta.
