Identifies the subset of the response functions by number that are to be approximated (the default is all functions).
Description::
In the \c surrogate model case, the specification first allows a
mixture of surrogate and actual response mappings through the use of
the optional \c id_surrogates specification. This identifies the
subset of the response functions by number that are to be approximated
(the default is all functions). The valid response function
identifiers range from 1 through the total number of response
functions (see \ref responses-response_functions).
