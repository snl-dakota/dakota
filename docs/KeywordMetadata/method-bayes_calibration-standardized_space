Blurb::Perform the MCMC process in a standardized probability space.

Description::This option transforms the inference process (the MCMC sampling
and any emulator model management) into a standardized probability space.  

The variable transformations performed are as described in \ref
method-polynomial_chaos-askey.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

The default for the Gaussian process and no emulator options is to
perform the MCMC process in the original probability space (no
transformation).  Polynomial chaos and stochastic collocation
emulators are always formed in standardized probability space, and
their .

<b> Expected Output </b>

The user will see the truth model evaluations performed in the
original space, whereas any diagnostics relating to the MCMC samples
(e.g., QUESO data in the outputData directory) will report points and
response data (i.e., response gradients and Hessians) that correspond
to the transformed space.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

Selecting standardized_space generally has the effect of scaling the
random variables to be of equal magnitude, which can improve the
efficiency of the MCMC process.
