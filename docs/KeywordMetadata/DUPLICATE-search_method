Select a search method for Newton-based optimizers
Description::
The \c search_method control is defined for all Newton-based
optimizers and is used to select between \c trust_region, \c
gradient_based_line_search, and \c value_based_line_search methods.
The \c gradient_based_line_search option uses the line search method
proposed by \cite More1994. This option
satisfies sufficient decrease and curvature conditions; whereas, \c
value_base_line_search only satisfies the sufficient decrease
condition. At each line search iteration, the \c
gradient_based_line_search method computes the function and gradient
at the trial point. Consequently, given expensive function
evaluations, the \c value_based_line_search method is preferred to the
\c gradient_based_line_search method. Each of these Newton methods
additionally supports the \c tr_pds selection for unconstrained
problems. This option performs a robust trust region search using
pattern search techniques. Use of a line search is the default for
bound-constrained and generally-constrained problems, and use of a \c
trust_region search method is the default for unconstrained problems.
