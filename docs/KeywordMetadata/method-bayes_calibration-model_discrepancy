(Experimental) Post-calibration calculation of model discrepancy correction

Description::
The goal of parameter calibration is to minimize the difference between 
experimental data, \f$d(x)\f$, and model observations, \f$M(\theta, x)\f$, 
where \f$\theta\f$ are the model parameters and \f$x\f$ is a configuration
variable, such as temperature or pressure. However, it is not uncommon that, at 
the conclusion of parameter calibration, the agreement between experimental 
data and the calibrated model is not "close enough." This is often due to 
model form or structural error. In this case, the canonical equation

\f[
d (x) = M (\theta, x) + \varepsilon
\f] 

is replaced by one that also includes model discrepancy \f$\delta(x)\f$,

\f[
d (x) = M (\theta, x) + \delta(x) + \varepsilon.
\f]

In the Dakota implementation, the calculation of \f$\delta(x)\f$ is performed 
after the model parameters \f$\theta\f$ are calibrated. For each observable
\f$d_i\f$, the discrepancy 

\f[
\delta_i(x_j) = d_i(x_j) - M_i(\theta^*, x_j)
\f]

is calculated for each value \f$x_j\f$ of the configuration variable, where
\f$\theta^*\f$ is the optimal parameter value obtained during the 
calibration. It should be emphasized that the model discrepancy is only a 
function of the configuration variables, and there is one discrepancy 
regression model for each observable \f$d_i\f$. This set of discrepancy 
models may be specified to be either Gaussian process or polynomial regression 
models of constant, linear, or quadratic order, and each model is fit to the 
calculated discrepancy values. See the 
\ref method-bayes_calibration-model_discrepancy-discrepancy_type 
command for more details regarding these options. 

The user 
may then specify new or "prediction" configurations at which the corrected 
model \f$M(\theta^*, x_{new}) + \delta(x_{new})\f$ should be calculated, using
one of the \c num_prediction_configs, \c prediction_configs, or
\c import_prediction_configs keywords. If none of these keywords is specified,
the number of prediction configurations is set to 10. The corresponding 
prediction variances are also calculated, according to

\f[
\Sigma_{total}(x) = \Sigma_{\delta}(x) + \sigma^2_{exp}I.
\f]

Here, \f$\Sigma_{\delta}(x)\f$ is the (co)variance calculated from the
Gaussian process or polynomial regression model, and \f$\sigma^2_{exp}\f$ is 
the maximum variance, taken over all configuration variables for that 
observation. Further details can be found in the Dakota User's and Theory 
Manuals.

<b> Expected Output </b>

The resulting values of 
\f$\delta(x_{new})\f$ will be exported to the file specified using
\c export_discrepancy_file or to the default file 
\c dakota_discrepancy_tabular.dat. The values of the corrected model at the
specified prediction configurations will be exported to the file specified 
using \c export_corrected_model_file or to the default file 
\c dakota_corrected_model_tabular.dat, and the corresponding prediction
variances will be exported to \c dakota_discrepancy_variance_tabular.dat
or the file specified with \c export_corrected_variance_file.
