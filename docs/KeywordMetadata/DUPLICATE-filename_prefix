Blurb::
User-customizable portion of exported model filenames

Description::
When a file-based export of a surrogate model is specified, %Dakota 
writes one file per response, per requested format. The files are named
using the pattern \c {prefix}.{response_descriptor}.{extension}.

The \c response_descriptor portion of the pattern is filled in using the
response \ref responses-descriptors provided by the user (or, if none are
specified, descriptors automatically generated by %Dakota). Extension is a
three or four letter string that depends on the format. The \c filename_prefix
keyword is used to supply the prefix portion of the pattern.

Examples::
This input snippet directs %Dakota to write one algebraic format file and one binary archive file
for each response. The names of the files will follow the patterns 
\c my_surrogate.{response_descriptor}.alg (for the algebraic files) and 
\c my_surrogate.{response_descriptor}.bsps (for the binary files).
