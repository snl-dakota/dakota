(Experimental Capability) Solves a mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem

Description::
The branch-and-bound optimization methods solves mixed integer nonlinear
optimization problems.  It does so by partitioning the parameter space
according to some criteria along the integer or discrete variables.  It
then relaxes (i.e., treats all variables as continuous) the sub-problems
created by the partitions and solves each sub-problem with a continuous
nonlinear optimization method.  Results of the sub-problems are combined
in such a way that yields the solution to the original optimization problem.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

Branch-and-bound expects all discrete variables to be relaxable.  If your
problem has categorical or otherwise non-relaxable discrete variables, then
this is not the optimization method you are looking for.

<b> Expected Output </b>

The optimal solution and associated parameters will be printed to the
screen output.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

The user must choose a nonlinear optimization method to solve the sub-
problems.  We recommend choosing a method that would be chosen to
solve a continuous problem that has similar form to the mixed integer
problem.
