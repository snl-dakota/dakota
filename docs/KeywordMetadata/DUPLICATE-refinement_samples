Blurb::
Number of samples used to refine a probabilty estimate or sampling design.

Description::

Probability estimate: Specify the (scalar) number of samples used to
improve a probabilty estimate. If using uni-modal sampling all samples
are assigned to the sampling center. If using multi-modal sampling the
samples are split between mutiple samples according to some internally
computed weights.

Sampling design: Specify one or a sequenence of refinement samples to
augment the initial_samples in a sampling design.
