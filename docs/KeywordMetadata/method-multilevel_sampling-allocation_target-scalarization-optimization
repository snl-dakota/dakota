method-multilevel_sampling-allocation_target-scalarization-optimization

Blurb:: 
Solve the optimization problem for the sample allocation by numerical optimization in the case of sampling estimator targeting the scalarization.

Description:: 
Employ numerical optimization to solve the optimization problem for finding the optimal sample allocation when targeting the scalarization metric. This option needs NPSOL (preferred choice) or OPTPP (alternative choice) installed.

Examples::
The following method block 
\verbatim
method,
	model_pointer = 'HIERARCH'
        multilevel_sampling
	  pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
	  convergence_tolerance = .01
	  allocation_target = scalarization
	  	scalarization_response_mapping = 1 0 0 0
                                                 0 0 1 3
                optimization                                 
\endverbatim

uses the scalarization as sample allocation target and solves the resulting optimization problem using numerical optimization.
