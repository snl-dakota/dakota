Blurb:: Specify a solution mode that estimates performance based on projecting initial correlation/variance estimates from a pilot sample

Description:: Multilevel / multifidelity sampling methods are adaptive
UQ methods that utilize a pilot sample to estimate an initial set of
correlations or variances, and then augment the pilot with additional
sample increments to optimally allocate resources.  In this mode,
evaluations are limited to the pilot sample and these initial estimates
are used to project the potential performance under the assumption that
these estimates are accurate.

This mode is useful for comparing the projected performance of different
estimators, which can inform method selection.
