Define coefficients of the linear equalities
Description::
In the equality case, the constraint matrix :math:`A` 
provides coefficients for the variables on the left hand side of:

.. math:: Ax = a_t
The linear_constraints topics page (linked above) outlines a few additional
things to consider when using linear constraints.
Topics::
linear_constraints
Examples::
An optimization involving three variables, ``x1``, ``x2``, and ``x3``, is to be
performed. These variables must satisfy a pair of linear equality constraints:


.. math::  1.5 dot ``x1`` + 1.0 dot ``x2`` = 5.0 
.. math::  3.0 dot ``x1`` - 4.0 dot ``x3`` = 0.0 
The pair of constraints can be written in matrix form as:


.. math:: \begin{bmatrix}
  1.5 & 1.0 & 0.0 \\
  3.0 & 0.0 & -4.0
\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}
  x1 \\
  x2 \\
  x3
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
  5.0 \\
  0.0
\end{bmatrix}


The coefficient matrix and right hand side are expressed to Dakota in the
:ref:`variables<variables>` section of the input file:


.. code-block::

    
    variables
      continuous_design 2
        descriptors 'x1' 'x2'
    
      linear_equality_constraint_matrix = 1.5  1.0  0.0
                                          3.0  0.0 -4.0
    
      linear_equality_targets = 5.0
                                0.0
