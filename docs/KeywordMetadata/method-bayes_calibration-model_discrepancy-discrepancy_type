Blurb::
Specify the type of model discrepancy

Description::
After the model parameters are calibrated, the difference between the data and
the calibrated model, i.e. the model discrepancy, is calculated

\f[
\delta_i(x_j) = d_i(x_j) - M_i(\theta^*, x_j).
\f]

Each \f$\delta_i\f$ corresponds to a different regression model. These 
regression models must all be either Gaussian process or polynomial models, and
they are functions of the configuration variable \f$x\f$. The order
of the trend function may be selected using the \c correction_order command
by specifying \c constant, \c linear, or \c quadratic.
