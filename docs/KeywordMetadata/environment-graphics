Blurb:: (DEPRECATED) Display plots of variables and responses

Description::
Activate Dakota's legacy X Windows-based graphics feature.  Dakota
plotting and visualization capabilities are increasingly available in
the Dakota graphical user interface (GUI); see the Dakota GUI User
Manual in the documentation section of the Dakota website for
additional details.

The \c graphics flag activates a 2D graphics window containing history
plots for the variables and response functions in the study. This
window is updated approximately every two seconds.  Some study types
such as surrogate-based optimization or local reliability specialize
the use of the graphics window.

There is no dependence between the \c graphics flag and the \c
tabular_data flag; they may be used independently or
concurrently.
