Pattern search, derivative free optimization method
Description::
Pattern search techniques are nongradient-based optimization methods
which use a set of offsets from the current iterate to locate improved
points in the design space.

\c coliny_pattern_search supports concurrency up to the size of 
the search pattern

Traditional pattern search methods search with a fixed pattern of
search directions to try to find improvements to the current iterate.
The SCOLIB pattern search methods generalize this simple algorithmic
strategy to enable control of how the search pattern is adapted, as
well as how each search pattern is evaluated. The \c stochastic and \c
synchronization specifications denote how the the trial points are
evaluated. The \c stochastic specification indicates that the trial
points are considered in a random order. For parallel pattern search,
\c synchronization dictates whether the evaluations are scheduled
using a \c blocking scheduler or a \c nonblocking scheduler.  In the
\c blocking case, all points in the pattern are evaluated (in
parallel), and if the best of these trial points is an improving
point, then it becomes the next iterate. These runs are reproducible,
assuming use of the same seed in the \c stochastic case.  In the \c
nonblocking case, all points in the pattern may not be evaluated,
since the first improving point found becomes the next iterate. Since
the algorithm steps will be subject to parallel timing variabilities,
these runs will not generally be repeatable. The \c synchronization
specification has similar connotations for sequential pattern
search. If \c blocking is specified, then each sequential iteration
terminates after all trial points have been considered, and if \c
nonblocking is specified, then each sequential iteration terminates
after the first improving trial point is evaluated. In this release,
both \c blocking and \c nonblocking specifications result in blocking
behavior (except in the case where \c exporatory_moves below is set to
\c adaptive_pattern). Nonblocking behavior will be re-enabled after
some underlying technical issues have been resolved.

The particular form of the search pattern is controlled by the \c
pattern_basis specification. If \c pattern_basis is \c coordinate
basis, then the pattern search uses a plus and minus offset in each
coordinate direction, for a total of \e 2n function evaluations in the
pattern. This case is depicted in Figure 5.3 for three coordinate
dimensions.

If \c pattern_basis is \c simplex, then pattern search uses a minimal
positive basis simplex for the parameter space, for a total of \e n+1
function evaluations in the pattern. Note that the \c simplex pattern
basis can be used for unbounded problems only. The \c
total_pattern_size specification can be used to augment the basic \c
coordinate and \c simplex patterns with additional function
evaluations, and is particularly useful for parallel load balancing.
For example, if some function evaluations in the pattern are dropped
due to duplication or bound constraint interaction, then the \c
total_pattern_size specification instructs the algorithm to generate
new offsets to bring the total number of evaluations up to this
consistent total.

The \c exploratory_moves specification controls how the search pattern
is adapted. (The search pattern can be adapted after an improving
trial point is found, or after all trial points in a search pattern
have been found to be unimproving points.)  The following exploratory
moves selections are supported by SCOLIB:

\li The \c basic_pattern case is the simple pattern search approach,
which uses the same pattern in each iteration.

\li The \c multi_step case examines each trial step in the pattern in
turn. If a successful step is found, the pattern search continues
examining trial steps about this new point. In this manner, the
effects of multiple successful steps are cumulative within a single
iteration. This option does not support any parallelism and will
result in a serial pattern search.

\li The \c adaptive_pattern case invokes a pattern search technique
that adaptively rescales the different search directions to maximize
the number of redundant function evaluations. See \cite Hart2001c
for details of this method.  In preliminary
experiments, this method had more robust performance than the standard
\c basic_pattern case in serial tests.  This option supports a limited
degree of parallelism. After successful iterations (where the step
length is not contracted), a parallel search will be performed. After
unsuccessful iterations (where the step length is contracted), only a
single evaluation is performed.

The \c initial_delta and \c threshold_delta specifications provide the
initial offset size and the threshold size at which to terminate the
algorithm. For any dimension that has both upper and lower bounds,
this step length will be internally rescaled to provide search steps
of length \c initial_delta * range * 0.1. This rescaling does not
occur for other dimensions, so search steps in those directions have
length \c initial_delta. Note that the factor of 0.1 in the rescaling
could result in an undesirably small initial step. This can be offset
by providing a large \c initial_delta.

In general, pattern search methods can expand and contract their step
lengths. SCOLIB pattern search methods contract the step length by the
value \c contraction_factor, and they expand the step length by the
value (1/contraction_factor). The \c expand_after_success control
specifies how many successful objective function improvements must
occur with a specific step length prior to expansion of the step
length, whereas the \c no_expansion flag instructs the algorithm to
forgo pattern expansion altogether.

Finally, constraint infeasibility can be managed in a somewhat more
sophisticated manner than the simple weighted penalty function. If the
\c constant_penalty specification is used, then the simple weighted
penalty scheme described above is used. Otherwise, the constraint
penalty is adapted to the value \c constraint_penalty/L, where L is
the the smallest step length used so far.
