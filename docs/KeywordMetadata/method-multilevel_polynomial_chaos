Blurb:: Multilevel uncertainty quantification using polynomial chaos expansions

Description:: 
As described in \ref method-polynomial_chaos, the polynomial chaos 
expansion (PCE) is a general framework for the approximate representation 
of random response functions in terms of series expansions in standardized 
random variables:

\f[R = \sum_{i=0}^P \alpha_i \Psi_i(\xi) \f]

where \f$\alpha_i\f$ is a deterministic coefficient, \f$\Psi_i\f$ is a
multidimensional orthogonal polynomial and \f$\xi\f$ is a vector of
standardized random variables. 

In the multilevel and multifidelity cases, we decompose this expansion
into several constituent expansions, one per model form or solution
control level.  In a bi-fidelity case with low-fidelity (LF) and
high-fidelity (HF) models, we have:

\f[R = \sum_{i=0}^{P^{LF}} \alpha^{LF}_i \Psi_i(\xi)
     + \sum_{i=0}^{P^{HF}}      \delta_i \Psi_i(\xi) \f]

where \f$\delta_i\f$ is a coefficient for the discrepancy expansion.



For the case of regression-based PCE (least squares, compressed sensing, 
or orthogonal least interpolation), an optimal sample allocation procedure 
can be applied for the resolution of each level within a multilevel sampling
procedure as in \ref method-multilevel_sampling.  The core difference
is that a Monte Carlo estimator of the statistics is replaced with a
PCE-based estimator of the statistics, requiring approximation of the 
variance of these estimators.

Initial prototypes for multilevel PCE can be explored using \c
dakota/share/dakota/test/dakota_uq_diffusion_mlpce.in, and will be stabilized in
future releases.
