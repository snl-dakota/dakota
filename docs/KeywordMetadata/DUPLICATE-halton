Generate samples from a Halton sequence
Description::
The quasi-Monte Carlo sequences of Halton are deterministic 
sequences determined by a set of prime bases. 
These sequences generate random numbers with the goal of 
filling a unit hypercube uniformly. 

Generally, we recommend that the user leave the default 
setting for the bases, which are the lowest primes. 
Thus, if one wants to generate a sample set for 3 random variables, 
the default bases used are 2, 3, and 5 in the Halton sequence.
To give an example of how these sequences look, the Halton sequence 
in base 2 starts with points 0.5, 0.25, 0.75, 0.125, 0.625, etc. 
The first few points in a Halton base 3 sequence are 
0.33333, 0.66667, 0.11111, 0.44444, 0.77777, etc. Notice that the Halton 
sequence tends to alternate back and forth, generating a point closer to zero 
then a point closer to one. An individual sequence is based on a radix 
inverse function defined on a prime base. The prime base determines 
how quickly the [0,1] interval is filled in.
