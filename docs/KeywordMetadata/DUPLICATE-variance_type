Add context to experiment data description by specifying the type of experimental error. 

Description::

There are four options for specifying the experimental error (e.g. the
measurement error in the data you provide for calibration purposes):
'none' (default), 'scalar', 'diagonal', or 'matrix.'

If the user specifies scalar, they can provide a scalar variance per
calibration term.  Note that for scalar calibration terms, only 'none'
or 'scalar' are options for the measurement variance.  However, for
field calibration terms, there are two additional options.  'diagonal'
allows the user to provide a vector of measurement variances (one for
each term in the calibration field).  This vector corresponds to the
diagonal of the full covariance matrix of measurement errors.  If the
user specifies 'matrix', they can provide a full covariance matrix
(not just the diagonal terms), where each element(i,j) of the
covariance matrix represents the covariance of the measurement error
between the i-th and j-th field values.
