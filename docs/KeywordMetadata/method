Blurb::
Begins Dakota method selection and behavioral settings.

Description::
The \c method keyword signifies the start of a block in the Dakota
input file.  A method block contains the various keywords necessary to
select a method and to control its behavior.

<b> Method Block Requirements </b>

At least one \c method block must appear in the Dakota input
file.  Multiple \c method blocks may be needed to fully define
advanced analysis approaches.

Each \c method block must specify one method and, optionally, any
associated keywords that govern the behavior of the method.

<b> The Methods </b>

Each \c method block must select one method.

Starting with Dakota v6.0, the methods are grouped into two types:
standard methods and multi-component methods.

The standard methods are
stand-alone and self-contained in the sense that they only require
a model to perform a study. They do not call other methods.
While methods such as \c
polynomial_chaos and \c efficient_global internally utilize multiple
iterator and surrogate model components, these components are
generally hidden from user control due to restrictions on modularity;
thus, these methods are stand-alone.

The multi-component group
of methods provides a higher level "meta-algorithm" that points to
other methods and models that support sub-iteration.
For example, in a sequential hybrid method, the \c hybrid
method specification must identify a list of subordinate methods, and
the "meta-algorithm" executes these methods in sequence and transfers
information between them. Surrogate-based minimizers provide another
example in that they point both to other methods (e.g. what
optimization method is used to solve the approximate subproblem) as
well as to models (e.g. what type of surrogate model is employed).
Multi-component methods generally provide some level of "plug and
play" modularity, through their flexible support of a variety of
method and model selections.

<b> Component-Based Iterator Commands </b>

Component-based iterator specifications include hybrid, multi-start,
pareto set, surrogate-based local, surrogate-based global, and branch
and bound methods. Whereas a standard iterator specification only
needs an optional model pointer string (specified with \c
model_pointer), component-based iterator specifications can include
method pointer, method name, and model pointer specifications in order
to define the components employed in the "meta-iteration." In
particular, these specifications identify one or more methods (by
pointer or by name) to specify the subordinate iterators that will be
used in the top-level algorithm. Identifying a sub-iterator by name
instead of by pointer is a lightweight option that relaxes the need
for a separate method specification for the sub-iterator; however, a
model pointer may be required in this case to provide the
specification connectivity normally supported by the method pointer.
Refer to these individual method descriptions for specific
requirements for these advanced methods.

<!-- Hybrid meta-iterators identify sub-iterators and sub-models using
either (a) lists of method pointers or lists of method names with
optional model pointers (sequential and collaborative hybrids), or (b)
global and local method pointers or global and local method names with
optional model pointers (embedded hybrid). Multi-start and pareto-set
meta-iterators identify a single sub-method either by pointer or name,
with the latter name case supporting an optional model pointer. The
branch and bound, surrogate-based local, and surrogate-based global
methods support a similar specification in identifying a sub-method by
either pointer or by name and either a required (surrogate-based) or
optional (branch and bound) model pointer. Each of the method
specifications identified by pointer has the responsibility for
identifying corresponding model specifications (using \c model_pointer),
 whereas methods identified by name cannot
delegate the need to identify a model by pointer. -->


<b> Method Independent Controls </b>

In addition to the method, there are 10 optional keywords, which 
are referred to as method independent controls. 
These controls are valid for enough methods that it was
reasonable to pull them out of the method dependent blocks and consolidate the
specifications, however, they are NOT universally respected by all methods.

Examples::
Several examples follow. The first example shows a minimal
specification for an optimization method.
\verbatim
method
  dot_sqp
\endverbatim
This example uses all of the defaults for this method. 

A more sophisticated example would be
\verbatim
method,
  id_method = 'NLP1'
  dot_sqp
    max_iterations = 50
    convergence_tolerance = 1e-4
    output verbose
    model_pointer = 'M1'
\endverbatim
This example demonstrates the use of identifiers and pointers
as well as some method independent and method
dependent controls for the sequential quadratic programming (SQP)
algorithm from the DOT library. The \c max_iterations, \c
convergence_tolerance, and \c output settings are method independent
controls, in that they are defined for a variety of methods (see \ref method-dot
 for usage of these controls). 

The next example shows a specification for a least squares method.
\verbatim
method
  optpp_g_newton
    max_iterations = 10
    convergence_tolerance = 1.e-8
    search_method trust_region
    gradient_tolerance = 1.e-6
\endverbatim
Some of the same method independent controls are present along with
several method dependent controls (\c search_method and \c
gradient_tolerance) which are only meaningful for OPT++ methods (see
\ref topic-package_optpp).

The next example shows a specification for a nondeterministic method
with several method dependent controls (refer to \ref method-sampling).
\verbatim
method
  sampling
    samples = 100
    seed = 12345
    sample_type lhs
    response_levels = 1000. 500.
\endverbatim

The last example shows a specification for a parameter study method
where, again, each of the controls are method dependent (refer to \ref
method-vector_parameter_study).
\verbatim
method
  vector_parameter_study
    step_vector = 1. 1. 1.
    num_steps = 10
\endverbatim
