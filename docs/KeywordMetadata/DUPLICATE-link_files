Paths to be linked into each working directory

Description::
Specifies the paths (files or directories) that will be symbolically
linked from each working directory.  Wildcards using * and ? are
permitted.  Linking is space-saving and useful for files not modified
during the function evaluation.  However, not all filesystems support
linking, for example, support on Windows varies.
