Blurb::
Supply calibration data in the case of field data or mixed data (both scalar and field data).

Description::

\c calibration_data specifies a keyword block that indicates that Dakota 
should read in various types of experimental data. 
This block is primarily to support the reading of field calibration data. 

The user will specify the number of experiments, \c num_experiments. 
If this is not specified, it is assumed there is only one experiment. 

For each experiment, there are four main types of data related to fields: 
<ul>
   <li> values.  

   These are the values of the experiment field (e.g. temperature values, voltage levels, etc.) 
   These MUST be specified in a file named response_descriptor.NUM.dat, where NUM is replaced 
   by the number of the experiment (1, 2, ...) and response_descriptor is replaced by the actual 
   \c response_descriptor the user has specified.  For example, if \c response_descriptor = voltage, 
   then the voltage field values for experiment 1 should be in a file labeled 
   voltage.1.dat. The field values should be in a column (e.g. one field value per row).
  
   </li>
   <li> field coordinates.  

   Field coordinates specify independent variables (e.g. spatial or temporal coordinates) upon which 
   the field depends.  For example, the voltage level above might be a function of time, so time is 
   the field coordinate.  If the user has field coordinates to read, they need to specify 
   \c read_field_coordinates.  The field coordinates will then be read from a file named 
   response_descriptor.NUM.coords, similar to the pattern for field values.  The number of columns 
   in the coords file should be equal to the number of field coordinates.  

   </li>
   <li> variance terms.  

   The user needs to specify \c variance_type, which defines the type of experimental measurement 
   error.  This is a string list, with one variance type specified for each scalar and each field.  
   The available types are 'none' (no variance is specified), 'scalar' (one scalar value is specified 
   which is applicable to all of the measurements in the field), 'diagonal' (a column vector is 
   provided which contains the number of elements of the experimental data field.  Each element of the    vector contains the experimental measurement variance corresponding to that particular field 
   measurement.  For example, for the fifth term in the field, the fifth term in the diagonal 
   vector would have the variance of that measurement), and 'matrix'.  In the matrix case, a 
   full covariance matrix is provided, which contains the pairwise correlations between each element 
   in the field.  For each field, if the \c variance_type is not 'none', a data file must be provided 
   with the name response_descriptor.NUM.sigma, which contains the appropriate variance data for 
   that field. 
  
   </li>
   <li> configuration variables.  

   Configuration variables specify the conditions corresponding to different experiments.  
   This is used when there is more than one experiment.  If \c num_config_variables is positive, 
   the configuration variables for each experiment should be placed in a file named 
   experiment.NUM.config, where the number of items in that config file are the 
   \c num_config_variables.

   </li>
</ul>

The above description is relevant for field data (with files for field values, field coordinates, 
field variances).  If the user also has scalar experimental data, it may be entered in the same way (e.g. 
one file for a scalar experimental value named scalar_response_descriptor.NUM.dat, etc.) 
However, the user can choose to enter the scalar data in the format that we offer for pure scalar 
data, where we have just one file, with the number of rows of that file equal to the number 
of experiments.  In that case, the scalar data is in the file given by the name \c scalar_data_file, 
and the format of that file is the same as discussed in \ref responses-calibration_terms-calibration_data_file.

One important feature of field data is the capability to interpolate 
between points in the field.  For example, we may have simulation data 
at a set of responses \f$ y \f$ at time points \f$ t \f$: 
(\f$ t_{s1}, y_{s1} \f$), (\f$ t_{s2}, y_{s2} \f$), etc. 
In this example, \f$ t \f$ is the independent coordinate for the simulation, and the simulation time and response points are denoted with subscripts \f$ s1, s2, s3, \f$.  If the user has experimental data that is taken at different time points:   
(\f$ t_{e1}, y_{e1} \f$), (\f$ t_{e2}, y_{e2} \f$), ..., 
it is necessary to interpolate the simulation data to provide estimates 
of the simulation response at the experimental time points to 
construct the residual terms (model - experiment) 
at the experimental time points.  Dakota can perform this interpolation 
now.  The user must specify the keyword \c interpolate, and also 
provide the field coordinates as well as field values for the 
experiment data.  If the \c interpolate keyword is not specified, 
Dakota will assume that the simulation field data and the experiment
field data is taken at the same set of independent coordinate values and 
simply construct the difference between these field terms to create the set of residuals for the sum-of-squares calculation.
