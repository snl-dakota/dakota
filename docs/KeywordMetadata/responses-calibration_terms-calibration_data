Blurb:: Supply field or mixed field/scalar calibration data

Description::

\c calibration_data specifies a keyword block that indicates that
Dakota should read in experimental data for calibration.  This block
is primarily to support the reading of field calibration data.  For
simpler, scalar-only response cases, see \ref
responses-calibration_terms-calibration_data_file.  The user will
typically specify the number of experiments, \c num_experiments.  If
this is not specified, it is assumed there is only one experiment.

Up to four types of data may be read.  They are read from a collection
of files, one per response descriptor, per experiment.  In this
discussion, DESC refers to the response descriptor and NUM to the
experiment number.

<ol>
<li> <b>Values:</b> The scalar or field-valued response function values,
     e.g., temperature values, voltage levels.  These are read from
     files named \c DESC.NUM.dat (one per response descriptor, per
     experiment), e.g, \c volts.1.dat, \c volts.2.dat.  Scalar files
     will contain a single value, while field files will each contain
     a column of field reponse values with length indicated in \ref
     responses-calibration_terms-field_calibration_terms-lengths. 
</li>
<li> <b>Coordinates:</b> Field coordinates specify independent variables
     (e.g., spatial or temporal coordinates) upon which the field
     depends.  For example, the voltage might be a function of time,
     so time is the field coordinate.  These are read from files named
     \c DESC.NUM.coords, each containing \ref
     responses-calibration_terms-field_calibration_terms-num_coordinates_per_field
     columns and 1 (scalar) or field length (\ref
     responses-calibration_terms-field_calibration_terms-lengths).
</li>
<li> <b>Variances:</b> If \ref
     responses-calibration_terms-calibration_data-variance_type is
     specified, variance values are read from files \c DESC.NUM.sigma.
     Note that a single \c variance_type may be specified, or a unique
     \c variance_type per response descriptor (per scalar or field).
     If the \c variance_type is:
     <ul>
     <li> 'scalar': a single variance value will be read from the file.
     </li>
     <li> 'diagonal' (field responses only): a column vector of
          variance values (length equal to length of the field) will
          be read from the file. The values are the variances of each
          field value for this descriptor.
     </li>
     <li> 'matrix' (field responses only): a matrix of covariance
          values (square with size the length of the field) will be
          read from the file. The matrix is a full covariance matrix
          for the components of this field response.  While covariance among entries in a field response may be specified, covariance among experiments is not permitted.
     </li>
     </ul>
</li>
<li> <b>Configuration variables:</b> specify the conditions
     corresponding to different experiments.  When
     responses-calibration_terms-calibration_data-num_config_variables
     is specified, the configuration variable values for each
     experiment should be placed in a file named \c
     experiment.NUM.config, where the number of items in that config
     file are the \c num_config_variables.  These variables are used
     as auxilliary state variables for the simulation (for example)
     and are not calibrated.
</li>
</ol>

<b>Aggregating scalar data:</b> The above description is primarily
relevant for field data (with files for field values, field
coordinates, field variances).  If the user also has scalar
experimental data, it may be entered as described above, i.e., one
file named DESC.NUM.dat per scalar response.  However, an alternative
is to provde the data for all scalar responses in aggregate in the
simpler \ref
responses-calibration_terms-calibration_data-scalar_data_file format,
with the number of rows of that file equal to the number of
experiments.  The scalar data file may be used in combination with the
the separate field files described above.

<b>Interpolation:</b> One important feature of field data is the
capability to interpolate between points in the field.  For example,
we may have simulation data at a set of responses \f$ y \f$ at time
points \f$ t \f$: (\f$ t_{s1}, y_{s1} \f$), (\f$ t_{s2}, y_{s2} \f$),
etc.  In this example, \f$ t \f$ is the independent coordinate for the
simulation, and the simulation time and response points are denoted
with subscripts \f$ s1, s2, s3, \f$.  If the user has experimental
data that is taken at different time points: (\f$ t_{e1}, y_{e1} \f$),
(\f$ t_{e2}, y_{e2} \f$), ..., it is necessary to interpolate the
simulation data to provide estimates of the simulation response at the
experimental time points to construct the residual terms (model -
experiment) at the experimental time points.  Dakota can perform 1-D
interpolation.  The user must specify the keyword \c interpolate, and
also provide the field coordinates as well as field values for the
experiment data.

If the \c interpolate keyword is not specified, Dakota will assume
that the simulation field data and the experiment field data is taken
at the same set of independent coordinate values and simply construct
the difference between these field terms to create the set of
residuals for the sum-of-squares calculation.  When \c interpolate is
specified, the simulation coordinates are assumed fixed and the same
for each simulation.  These simulation coordinates are provided in
DESC.coords.  However, the experiment coordinates for each
experiment can be different, and are provided in the files numbered by
experiment with the file names given by DESC.NUM.coords, as indicated
above.

Examples::

Consider this field example with three field-valued responses (volts as a function
of 7 time points, amps as a function of 3 time points, and power as a
function of 5 time points).  The experiments each have one coordinate (time) 
per field. The experiments were conducted given values of two configuration variables. 
There are four experiments (note that there often is only one experiment).

\verbatim
responses
  descriptors = 'volts' 'amps' 'power'
  calibration_terms = 3

    #define field terms
    field_calibration_terms = 3
      lengths = 7 3 5
      num_coordinates_per_field = 1 1 1
      read_field_coordinates
    
    # specify the data
    calibration_data
      num_experiments = 4
      num_config_variables = 2
      variance_type 'diagonal' 'scalar' 'matrix' 
\endverbatim

<!-----
Consider this mixed scalar/field example with 2 scalar responses
(max_temp, size) and three field-valued responses (volts as a function
of 7 time points, amps as a function of 3 time points, and power as a
function of 5 time points).  The experiments were conducted given
values of two configuration variables.

\verbatim
responses
  descriptors = 'max_temp' 'size' 'volts' 'amps' 'power'
  calibration_terms = 5

    # define the scalar and field terms
    scalar_calibration_terms = 2
    field_calibration_terms = 3
      lengths = 7 3 5
      num_coordinates_per_field = 1 1 1
      read_field_coordinates

    # specify the data
    calibration_data
      num_experiments = 4
      num_config_variables = 2
      variance_type 'scalar' 'scalar' 'diagonal' 'scalar' 'matrix' 
      scalar_data_file 'circuit.dat'
        annotated
\endverbatim

All of the scalar data will be read from a single data file \c
circuit.dat.  Per \ref
responses-calibration_terms-calibration_data_file, it must have 4
rows, and a total of 5 columns, with scalar variance information:

\verbatim
%exp_id | configuration xvars | max_temp size    | y data variances
1         7.8  7                21.9372  1.8687    0.25  0.04
2         8.6  2                19.0779  4.8976    0.25  0.04
3         8.4  8                38.2758  4.4559    0.25  0.04
4         4.2  1                39.7600  6.4631    0.25  0.04
\endverbatim
---->   
The field data will be read from separate files:   
<ol>

<li> <b>Values:</b> 7 values for voltage as a function of time will be
        read from each of \c volts.1.dat ... \c volts.4.dat, while the 3
        values of amperage come from \c amps.1.dat, ..., \c amps.4.dat and
        the 5 values of power will come from \c power.1.dat, ..., \c
        power.4.dat.
</li>

<li> <b>Coordinates:</b> The corresponding time values will be read
     from a single column vector in each of the files volts.*.coords,
     amps.*.coords, and power.*.coords.
</li>
<li> <b>Variances:</b> Will be read per-experiment (no covariance
     among experiments is permitted).  The variance information is depicted 
     graphically in \ref 
     responses-calibration_terms-calibration_data-variance_type
     <ul>
     <li> Volts specifies 'diagonal' covariance, so a column vector of
          length 7 with the diagonal variances will be read from each
          of \c volts.1.sigma, ..., \c volts.4.sigma.  
     </li>
     <li> Amps specifies 'scalar' covariance, so a single variance
          value will read from each of \c amps.1.sigma, ..., \c
          amps.4.sigma.  
     </li>
     <li> Power specifies 'matrix' covariance, so a square 5 x 5
          covariance matrix will be read from each of \c power.1.sigma,
          ..., \c power.4.sigma.
     </li>
     </ul>
</li>
<li> <b>Configuration variables:</b> Will be read from a set of files named \c
     \c experiment.1.config, ..., \c experiment.4.config.
</li>
</ol>
