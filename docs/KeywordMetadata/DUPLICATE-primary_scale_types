Choose a scaling type for each response

Description::
The \c primary_scale_types keyword specifies one or number of primary
functions strings indicating the scaling type for each response value
in methods that support scaling, when scaling is enabled.  If only one
type is specified, it will apply to each prinary response function.

See the scaling information under specific methods, e.g.,
method-*-scaling for details on how to use this keyword.

Note that primary response functions (objective, calibration, or
response functions) cannot be automaticaly scaled due to lack of
bounds, so valid scale types are \c 'none' \c 'value' and \c 'log'.

If scaling is specified, it is applied before multi-objective weighted
sums are formed.
