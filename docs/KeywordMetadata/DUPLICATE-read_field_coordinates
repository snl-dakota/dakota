Add context to data: flag to indicate that field coordinates should be read
Description::
 Field coordinates specify independent variables (e.g. spatial or temporal coordinates) upon which
   the field depends.  For example, the voltage level above might be a function of time, so time is
   the field coordinate.  If the user has field coordinates to read, they need to specify
   \c read_field_coordinates.  The field coordinates will then be read from a file named
   response_descriptor.coords, where response_descriptor is the user-provided descriptor for the 
   field response.  The number of columns in the coords file should be equal to the number of field coordinates.
