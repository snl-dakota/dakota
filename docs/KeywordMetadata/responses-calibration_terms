Blurb::
Response type suitable for calibration or least squares

Description::
Responses for a calibration study are specified using \c
calibration_terms and optional keywords for weighting/scaling, data,
and constraints.  In general when calibrating, Dakota automatically
tunes parameters \f$ \theta \f$ to minimize discrepancies or residuals
between the model and the data:

\f[ R_{i} = y^{Model}_i(\theta) - y^{Data}_{i}. \f]

There are two use cases:

\li If calibration data <em>is not specified</em>, then each of the
  calibration terms returned to Dakota through the \ref interface is a
  residual \f$ R_{i} \f$ to be driven toward zero.

\li If calibration data <em>is specified</em>, then each of the
  calibration terms returned to Dakota must be a response \f$
  y^{Model}_i(\theta) \f$, which Dakota will difference with the data
  in the specified data file.

<b> Constraints </b>

The keywords \c nonlinear_inequality_constraints, and \c
nonlinear_equality_constraints specify the number of nonlinear
inequality constraints, and nonlinear equality constraints,
respectively.  When interfacing to external applications, the
responses must be returned to %Dakota in this order: calibration
terms, nonlinear_inequality_constraints, then
nonlinear_equality_constraints.

Any linear constraints present in an application need only be input to
an optimizer at start up and do not need to be part of the data
returned on every function evaluation. These are therefore specified
in the method block.

<b> Optional Keywords </b>

The optional keywords relate to scaling responses (for better
numerical results), dealing with multiple residuals, and importing
data.

See the \c scaling keyword in the \ref method section for more details
on scaling.  If scaling is specified, then it is applied to each
residual prior to squaring: \f[f = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i
(\frac{y^{Model}_i - y^{Data}_i}{s_i})^2\f]

In the case where experimental data uncertainties are supplied, then
the weights are automatically defined to be the inverse of the
experimental variance: \f[f = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{\sigma^2_i}
(\frac{y^{Model}_i - y^{Data}_i}{s_i})^2\f]

Theory::

%Dakota calibration terms are typically used to solve problems of
parameter estimation, system identification, and model
calibration/inversion. Local least squares calibration problems are
most efficiently solved using special-purpose least squares solvers
such as Gauss-Newton or Levenberg-Marquardt; however, they may also be
solved using any general-purpose optimization algorithm in %Dakota.
While Dakota can solve these problems with either least squares or
optimization algorithms, the response data sets to be returned from
the simulator are different when using \ref
responses-objective_functions versus \ref responses-calibration_terms.

Least squares calibration involves a set of residual
functions, whereas optimization involves a single objective function
(sum of the squares of the residuals), i.e., \f[f = \sum_{i=1}^{n}
R_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(y^{Model}_i(\theta) - y^{Data}_{i} \right)^2 \f] 
where \e f is the objective function and the set of \f$R_i\f$
are the residual functions, most commonly defined as the difference between a model response and data. Therefore, function values and derivative
data in the least squares case involve the values and derivatives of
the residual functions, whereas the optimization case involves values
and derivatives of the sum of squares objective function. This means that 
in the least squares calibration case, the user must return each of 
\c n residuals 
separately as a separate calibration term. Switching
between the two approaches sometimes requires different simulation
interfaces capable of returning the different granularity of response
data required, although %Dakota supports automatic recasting of
residuals into a sum of squares for presentation to an optimization
method. Typically, the user must compute the difference between the 
model results and the observations when computing the residuals. 
However, the user has the option of specifying the observational data 
(e.g. from physical experiments or other sources) in a file.
