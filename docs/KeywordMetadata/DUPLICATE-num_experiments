Add context to data: number of different experiments
Description::
The number of different experiments.  Dakota will expand the total 
number of residual terms based on the number of calibration terms and 
the number of experiments.  For example, if the number of calibration terms 
are five scalars, and there are three experiments, the total number of 
residuals in the least squares formulation will be 15.
