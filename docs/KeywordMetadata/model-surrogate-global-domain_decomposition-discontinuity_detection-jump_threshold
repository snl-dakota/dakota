Gradient Threshold Parameter of the Optional Discontinuity Detection Capability for the Piecewise Decomposition Option of Global Surrogates

Description:: 
The piecewise decomposition option for global surrogates is used to locally approximate a function at some point using a few sample points from its neighborhood.

The domain decomposition algorithm supports an optional discontinuity detection capability where seeds across a user-input discontinuity threshold are not considered neighbors when building the approximate connectivity Delaunay graph. Alternatively, the domain is split into patches that trap discontinuities between them. This capability can be specified using a jump threshold value in the input spec.
