Blurb::
Trust-region method for nonlinear least squares
Description::
NL2SOL is available as \c nl2sol and addresses unconstrained and
bound-constrained least squares problems. It uses a trust-region method (and thus
can be viewed as a generalization of the Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm) and adaptively chooses between two Hessian approximations,
the Gauss-Newton approximation alone and the Gauss-Newton
approximation plus a quasi-Newton approximation to the rest of the
Hessian. Even on small-residual problems, the latter Hessian
approximation can be useful when the starting guess is far from the
solution. On problems that are not over-parameterized (i.e., that do
not involve more optimization variables than the data support), NL2SOL
usually exhibits fast convergence.

Several internal NL2SOL convergence tolerances are adjusted in response to \c
function_precision, which gives the relative precision to which
responses are computed. 

These tolerances may also be specified explicitly using: 
\li \c convergence_tolerance   (NL2SOL's \c rfctol) 
\li \c x_conv_tol              (NL2SOL's \c xctol) 
\li \c absolute_conv_tol       (NL2SOL's \c afctol)
\li \c singular_conv_tol       (NL2SOL's \c sctol)
\li \c false_conv_tol          (NL2SOL's \c xftol)
\li \c initial_trust_radius    (NL2SOL's \c lmax0)

The internal NL2SOL defaults can be obtained for many of these
controls by specifying the value -1. 
The internal defaults are often functions of machine epsilon 
(as limited by \c function_precision).

Examples::
An example of \c nl2sol is given below, and is discussed in the User's Manual.

Note that in this usage of \ref responses-calibration_terms, the driver script
\c rosenbrock, is returning "residuals", which the \c nl2sol method is attempting
to minimze. Another use case is to provide a data file, which Dakota will 
attempt to match the model responses to. See \ref responses-calibration_terms-calibration_data_file.
Finally, as of Dakota 6.2, the field data capability may be used with \c nl2sol.
That is, the user can specify field simulation data and field experiment data,
and Dakota will interpolate and provide the proper residuals for the calibration.

Theory::
NL2SOL has a variety of internal controls as described in AT&T Bell
Labs CS TR 153 (http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cstr/153.ps.gz). A
number of existing %Dakota controls (method independent controls and
responses controls) are mapped into these NL2SOL internal controls.
In particular, %Dakota's \c convergence_tolerance, \c max_iterations,
\c max_function_evaluations, and \c fd_gradient_step_size are mapped
directly into NL2SOL's \c rfctol, \c mxiter, \c mxfcal, and \c dltfdj
controls, respectively. In addition, %Dakota's \c fd_hessian_step_size
is mapped into both \c delta0 and \c dltfdc, and %Dakota's \c output
verbosity is mapped into NL2SOL's \c auxprt and \c outlev (for \c
normal/\c verbose/\c debug \c output, NL2SOL prints initial guess,
final solution, solution statistics, nondefault values, and changes to
the active bound constraint set on every iteration; for \c quiet \c
output, NL2SOL prints only the initial guess and final solution; and
for \c silent \c output, NL2SOL output is suppressed).
