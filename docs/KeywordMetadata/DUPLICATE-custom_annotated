Selects custom-annotated tabular file format
Description::
A custom-annotated tabular file is a whitespace-separated text file
typically containing row data for variables, or variables followed by
responses, though the format is used for other tabular exports/imports
as well.  Custom-annotated allows user options for whether ``header``
row, ``eval_id`` column, and ``interface_id`` column appear in the
tabular file, thus bridging ``freeform`` and (fully) ``annotated``.

*Default Behavior*

The ``annotated`` format is the default for tabular export/import. To
control which header row and columns are in the input/output, specify
``custom_annotated``, followed by options, in the relevant
export/import context.

*Usage Tips*


- Prior to October 2011, calibration and surrogate data files were in free-form format. They now default to ``annotated`` format, though ``freeform`` remains an option.
- When importing tabular data, a warning will be generated if a specific number of data are expected, but extra is found and an error generated when there is insufficient data.
- Some TPLs like SCOLIB and JEGA manage their own file I/O and only support the ``freeform`` option.

Examples::
Export a custom-annotated tabular file in Dakota 6.0 format, which
contained only header and eval_id (no interface_id), and data for
variables and responses.  Input file fragment:

.. code-block::

    environment
      tabular_data
        tabular_data_file = 'dakota_summary.dat'
        custom_annotated header eval_id

Resulting tabular file:

.. code-block::

    eval_id             x1             x2         obj_fn nln_ineq_con_1 nln_ineq_con_2
