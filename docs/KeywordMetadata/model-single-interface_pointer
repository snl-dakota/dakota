Interface block pointer for the single model type

Description:: 
In the \c single model case, a single interface is used to map the
variables into responses.  The optional \c interface_pointer
specification identifies this interface by cross-referencing with the
\c id_interface string input from a particular interface keyword
specification.

See \ref topic-block_pointer for details about pointers.

When an interface pointer is not specified, the model will use the last
interface block parsed from the input file.
