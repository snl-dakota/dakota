Turn on scaling for variables, responses, and constraints
Description::
Some of the optimization and calibration methods support
scaling of 
continuous design variables, objective functions, calibration terms,
and constraints.
This is activated by by providing the
\c scaling keyword.
Discrete variable scaling is not supported.

When
scaling is enabled, variables, functions, gradients, Hessians, etc.,
are transformed such that the method iterates in scaled variable
space, whereas evaluations of the computational model as specified in
the interface are performed on the original problem scale.
Therefore
using scaling does not require rewriting the interface to the
simulation code.

Scaling also requires the specification of additional keywords
which are found in the \ref method, \ref variables, and \ref responses
blocks.
When the \c scaling keyword is omitted, all \c
*_scale_types and \c *_scales specifications are ignored in the
method, variables, and responses sections.

This page describes the usage of all scaling related keywords.
The additional keywords come in pairs, one pair for each set
of quantities to be scaled.
These quantities can be
constraint equations, variables, or responses.
\li a \c *scales keyword, which gives characteristic values
\li a \c *scale_type keyword, which determines how to use the 
  characteristic values

The pair of keywords both take argument(s), and
the length of the arguments can either be zero, one, or equal
to the number of quantities to be scaled.
If one argument is given, it will apply to all quantities in
the set. See the examples below.

<b> Scale Types </b>

There are four scale types:
<ol>
  <li> \c none (default) - no scaling, value of \c *scales keyword is ignored
  </li>
  <li> \c value - multiplicative scaling
  </li>
  <li> \c auto - automatic scaling

     First the quantity is scaled by the characteristic value, then
     automatic scaling will be attempted according to the following scheme:

    <ul> 
      <li> two-sided bounds scaled into the interval [0,1]; 
      <li> one-sided bound or targets are scaled by the characteristic
         value, moving the bound or target to 1 and changing the sense of
         inequalities where necessary;
      <li> no bounds or targets: no automatic scaling possible, therefore no 
           scaling for this component 
    </ul> 

     Automatic scaling is not available for objective functions nor calibration 
     terms since they lack bound constraints. Futher, when automatically
     scaled, linear constraints are scaled by characteristic values only, not
     affinely scaled into [0,1]. 
  <li> \c log - logarithmic scaling

     First, any characteristic values from the
     optional \c *_scales specification are applied. Then logarithm base
     10 scaling is applied.

     Logarithmic scaling is not available for
     linear constraints.

     When continuous design variables are log
     scaled, linear constraints are not allowed.
  </li>
</ol>


<b> Scales </b>

The \c *scales keywords are used to specify the characteristic values.
These must be non-zero real numbers. The numbers are used according
to the corresponding \c *scale_type, as described above.

Depending on the scale type, the characteristic values may be required or
optional.
\li \c none, \c auto, \c log - optional
\li \c value - required.



A warning is issued if scaling would result in
division by a value smaller in magnitude than <tt>1.0e10*DBL_MIN</tt>.
User-provided values violating this lower bound are accepted
unaltered, whereas for automatically calculated scaling, the lower
bound is enforced.
