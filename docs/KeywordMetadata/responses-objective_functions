Blurb::
Response type suitable for optimization

Description::

Specifies the number (1 or more) of objective functions returned to Dakota.

<b> Constraints </b>

The keywords \c nonlinear_inequality_constraints, and \c
nonlinear_equality_constraints specify the number of nonlinear
inequality constraints, and nonlinear equality constraints,
respectively.  When interfacing to external applications, the
responses must be returned to %Dakota in this order: objective
functions, nonlinear_inequality_constraints, then
nonlinear_equality_constraints.

Any linear constraints present in an application need only be input to
an optimizer at start up and do not need to be part of the data
returned on every function evaluation. These are therefore specified
in the \ref method block.

Bounds on the design variables are specified in the \ref variables block.

<b> Optional Keywords </b>

The optional keywords relate to scaling the objective functions (for
better numerical results), formulating the problem as minimization or
maximization, and dealing with multiple objective functions.  If
scaling is used, it is applied before multi-objective weighted sums
are formed.
