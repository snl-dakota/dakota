Prioritize feasible designs
Description::
This replacement operator will always prefer a more feasible design to
a less feasible one. Beyond that, it favors solutions based on an
assigned fitness value which must have been installed by the weighted
sum only fitness assessor.

The \c favor_feasible replacement type first considers feasibility as
a selection criteria. If that does not produce a "winner" then it
moves on to considering fitness value. Because of this, any fitness
assessor used with the \c favor_feasible selector must only account
objectives in the creation of fitness. Therefore, there is such a
fitness assessor and it's use is enforced when the \c favor_feasible
selector is chosen. In that case, and if the output level is set high
enough, a message will be presented indicating that the \c
weighted_sum_only fitness assessor will be used.
