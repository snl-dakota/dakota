Blurb::
Supply calibration data in a text file (ONLY FOR SCALAR DATA)
Description::

This specification block outlines keywords that allow calibration 
data to be read into Dakota.  It assumes there are only scalar 
data calibration terms:  that is, no field_calibration_terms have 
been defined.

\c calibration_data_file specifies a text file containing data which
Dakota will attempt to match by calibrating the model variables. The
options for it related to either:
  \li format: whether the data file is in \c annotated, or \c freeform format
  \li content: where \c num_experiments, \c
    num_config_variables, and \c variance_type indicate which
    columns appear in the data.

While some components may be omitted, the most complete version of a
an annotated calibration data file could include columns corresponding
to:
\verbatim
index | configuration xvars | y data observations | y data variances
\endverbatim

Here each such row in the file corresponds to an experiment or
replicate observation of an experiment to be compared to the model
output.  NOTE:  the \c calibration_data_file is ONLY meant when 
you have scalar calibration terms.  If you have field calibration 
terms, you should use \c calibration_data and the associated specification 
below it.

<b> Simple case </b>

In the simplest case, no data content descriptors are specified, so
the data file must contain only the \f$ y^{Data} \f$ observations which
represent a single experimental observation.  In this case, the data
file should have \f$ N_{terms} \f$ columns and 1 row, where \f$
N_{terms} \f$ is the value of \ref responses-calibration_terms.

For each function evaluation, Dakota will run the analysis driver,
which must return \f$ N_{terms} \f$ model responses. Then the
residuals are computed as: \f[ R_{i} = y^{Model}_i - y^{Data}_{i}. \f]

These residuals can be weighted using \ref responses-calibration_terms-weights.

<b> With experimental variances </b>

If information is known about the measurement error and the uncertainty in the measurement, 
that can be specified by sending the measurement error variance to Dakota. 
In this case, the keyword \c variance_type is added, followed 
by a string of variance types of length one or of length 
\f$N_{terms} \f$ , where \f$
N_{terms} \f$ is the value of \ref responses-calibration_terms.
The \c variance_type for each response can be 'none' or 'scalar'. 
NOTE:  you must specify the same \c variance_type for all scalar terms. 
That is, they will all be 'none' or all be 'scalar.'

For each response that has a 'scalar' variance type, 
each row of the datafile will now have \f$ N_{terms} \f$
y data values followed by \f$ N{terms} columns that specify 
the measurement error (in units of variance, not standard deviation of the measurement error) 
for \f$ y variances. 

Dakota will run the analysis driver, which must return \f$ N_{terms}
\f$ responses. Then the residuals are computed as: 

\f[ R_{i} = \frac{y^{Model}_i - y^{Data}_{i}}{sqrt{{var}_i}} \f] 

for \f$ i = 1 \dots N_{terms} \f$.  

<b> Fully general case </b>

In the most general case, the content of the data file is described by
the arguments of three parameters. The parameters are optional, and
defaults are described below.

<ul>
  <li> \c num_experiments ( \f$ N_{exp} \f$ )

    Default: \f$ N_{exp} = N_{terms} \f$ 

    This indicates that the data represents multiple experiments,
    where each experiment might be conducted with different values of
    configuration variables.  An experiment can also be thought 
    of as a replicate, where the experiments are 
    run at the same values of the configuration variables. 
  </li>
  <li> \c num_config_variables ( \f$ N_{cfg} \f$ )

    This is not yet supported, but will specify the values of
    experimental conditions at which data were collected.

  </li>
  <li> \c variance_type ('none' or 'scalar')

    This indicates if the data file contains variances for measurement error 
    of the experimental data.  The default is 'none'.

  </li>
</ul>

If the user does not specify \c variance_type, or if the \c variance_type = 'none', 
only the actual observations are specified in the \c calibration_data_file. 
If the user specifies \c variance_type = 'scalar', then the \c calibration_data_file 
must contain two times \c calibration_terms.
The first \c calibration_terms columns are the experimental data, and
the second \c calibration_terms columns are the experimental measurement error variance.
For example, if the user has three \c calibration terms,
and specifies \c variance_type = 'scalar', then the calibration data
must contain six columns. The first three columns will contain the
data, and the second three columns will contain the experimental error (in units of variance)
for the data in the first three columns. 
These variances are used to weight the residuals in the sum-of-squares
objective.

A more advanced use of the \c calibration_data_file might specify \c
num_experiments \f$ N_E \f$ 
indicating that there are multiple experiments.
When multiple experiments are present, %Dakota will expand the number of residuals
for the repeat measurement data and difference with the data
accordingly. For example, if the user has five experiments
in the example above with three calibration
terms, the \c calibration_data_file would need to contain five rows
(one for each experiment), and each row should contain three
experimental data values that will be differenced with respect to the
appropriate model response. In this example, \f$ N_E = 5 \f$.
To summarize, %Dakota
will calculate the sum of the squared residuals as: \f[f =
\sum_{i=1}^{N_E}R_{i}^2\f] where the residuals
now are calculated as: \f[R_{i} = y^{Model}_i(\theta) - y^{Data}_{i}. \f]
