Blurb::
Use information from the existing surrogate model to predict what the surrogate upgrade 
will be with new points.
Description::
The strategy first selects
the highest scoring candidate, and then refits the surrogate using a ''lie'' value
at the point selected.  The 'lie' value is based on the surrogate predictions and not the simulation.  This process repeats until \c n points have been selected
whereupon the lie values are removed from the surrogate and the selected points
are evaluated on the true model and the surrogate is refit with these values.
