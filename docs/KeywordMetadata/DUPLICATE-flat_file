Read initial solutions from file
Description::
\c flat_file allows the initial population to be read from a flat
file. If \c flat_file is specified, a file name must be given.

%Variables can be delimited in the flat file in any way you see fit
with a few exceptions. The delimiter must be the same on any given
line of input with the exception of leading and trailing whitespace.
So a line could look like: 1.1, 2.2 ,3.3 for example but could not
look like: 1.1, 2.2 3.3. The delimiter can vary from line to line
within the file which can be useful if data from multiple sources is
pasted into the same input file.  The delimiter can be any string that
does not contain any of the characters .+-dDeE or any of the digits
0-9. The input will be read until the end of the file. The algorithm
will discard any configurations for which it was unable to retrieve at
least the number of design variables. The objective and constraint
entries are not required but if ALL are present, they will be recorded
and the design will be tagged as evaluated so that evaluators may
choose not to re-evaluate them.

Setting the size for this initializer has the effect of requiring a
minimum number of designs to create. If this minimum number has not
been created once the files are all read, the rest are created using
the \c unique_random initializer and then the \c simple_random
initializer if necessary.
