Specify the number of samples taken on the emulator to estimate the Probability of Failure in POF Darts
Description::
The last step of the POF Darts method involves constructing an emulator over the points identified thus far, 
and sampling that emulator extensively to estimate the probability of failure.  \c emulator_samples allows 
one to specify the number of samples taken on the emulator.  The default is 1E+6.  
If the probability of failure estimate is zero, the user may want to increase the number of 
emulator samples.
