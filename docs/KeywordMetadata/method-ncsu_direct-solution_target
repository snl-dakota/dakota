Blurb::
Specifies a globally optimal value toward which the optimizer should track
Description::
The solution target specifies a goal toward which the optimizer should
track.

This is used for test problems, when the true global minimum is known
(call it \c solution_target := fglobal). Then, the optimization
terminates when 100(f_min-fglobal)/max(1,abs(fglobal) <
convergence_tolerance. The default for fglobal is -1.0e100 and the
default for convergence tolerance is described at \ref
method-ncsu_direct-convergence_tolerance.
