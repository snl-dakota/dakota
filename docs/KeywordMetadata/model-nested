A model whose responses are computed through the use of a sub-iterator
Description::
Instead of appealing directly to a primary interface, a nested model
maps variables to responses by executing a secondary iterator, or a 
"sub-iterator".
In other words, a function evaluation of the primary study consists of a
solution of an entire secondary study - potentially many secondary
function evaluations.

The sub-iterator in turn operates on a
sub-model. The sub-iterator responses may be combined with non-nested
contributions from an optional interface specification.

A <b> \c sub_method_pointer </b> must be provided
in order to specify the method block describing the sub-iterator.
The remainder of the model is specified under that keyword.

A \b \c optional_interface_pointer points
to the interface specification and \c
optional_interface_responses_pointer points to a responses
specification describing the data to be returned by this interface).
This interface is used to provide non-nested data, which is then
combined with data from the nested iterator using the \c
primary_response_mapping and \c secondary_response_mapping inputs (see
mapping discussion below).

Examples::
An example of variable and response mappings is provided below:
\verbatim
primary_variable_mapping  = '' '' 'X'   'Y'
secondary_variable_mapping = '' '' 'mean' 'mean'
primary_response_mapping  = 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.
secondary_response_mapping = 0. 0. 0. 1. 3. 0. 0. 0. 0.
               0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 3. 0.
\endverbatim

The variable mappings correspond to 4 top-level variables, the first
two of which employ the default mappings from active top-level
variables to sub-model variables of the same type (option 3 above) and
the latter two of which are inserted into the mean distribution
parameters of sub-model variables \c 'X' and \c 'Y' (option 1 above).
The response mappings define a 3 by 9 matrix corresponding to 9 inner
loop response attributes and 3 outer loop response functions (one
primary response function and 2 secondary functions, such as one
objective and two constraints). Each row of the response mapping is a
vector which is multiplied (i.e, with a dot-product) against the 9
sub-iterator values to determine the outer loop function. Consider a
UQ example with 3 response functions, each providing a mean, a
standard deviation, and one level mapping (if no level mappings are
specified, the responses would only have a mean and standard
deviation). The primary response mapping can be seen to extract the
first value from the inner loop, which would correspond to the mean of
the first response function. This mapped sub-iterator response
becomes a single objective function, least squares term, or generic
response function at the outer level, as dictated by the top-level
response specification. The secondary response mapping maps the
fourth sub-iterator response function plus 3 times the fifth
sub-iterator response function (mean plus 3 standard deviations) into
one top-level nonlinear constraint and the seventh sub-iterator
response function plus 3 times the eighth sub-iterator response
function (mean plus 3 standard deviations) into another top-level
nonlinear constraint, where these top-level nonlinear constraints may
be inequality or equality, as dictated by the top-level response
specification. Note that a common case is for each sub-iterator
response to be mapped to a unique outer loop response (for example, in
the nested UQ case where one wants to determine an interval on each
inner loop statistic). In these simple cases, the response mapping
would define an identity matrix. <!-- That is, the primary response
mapping will have N rows and N columns corresponding to the N
sub-iterator response values, and the mapping matrix will have a value
of one along the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. -->
