Blurb::
Augments an existing random sampling study

Description::
\c incremental_random will augment an existing random sampling study
with more samples to get better estimates of mean, variance, and
percentiles.  The number of samples in the second set MUST currently
be 2 times the number of previous samples, although incremental
sampling based on any power of two may be supported in future
releases.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

Incremental random sampling is not used by default.  To change this
behavior, the \c incremental_random keyword must be specified in
conjuction with the \c sample_type keyword.  Additionally, a previous
random sampling study with sample size N must have already been
performed, and the dakota restart file must be available from this
previous study. The variables and responses specifications must be the
same in both studies.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

The incremental approach is useful if it is uncertain how many
simulations can be completed within available time.

Examples::
For example, say a user performs
an initial study using \c random as the \c sample_type, and generates 50
samples. If the user creates a new input file where \c samples is now
specified to be 100, the \c sample_type is defined to be \c
incremental_random, and \c previous_samples is
specified to be 50, the user will get 50 new random samples. 
The N new samples will be combined with the N previous
samples to generate a combined sample of size 2N. 

The method block would be the following:
\verbatim
method
  sampling
    sample_type incremental_random
    samples = 100
    previous_samples = 50
\endverbatim
The syntax for
running the second sample set is: 
\verbatim 
dakota -i input2.in -r dakota.rst
\endverbatim
where \c input2.in is the file which specifies
incremental sampling and dakota.rst is the restart
file containing the results of the previous study.
