Augments an existing random sampling study

Description::
\c incremental_random will augment an existing random sampling study
with more samples to get better estimates of mean, variance, and
percentiles.  There is no constraint on the number of samples in the second set
as there is with incremental LHS.  With \c incremental_random, 
one can have different sample sizes in the original and incremental set. 
This method can be used, for example, if you have 50 samples from a first 
study and find out that you are able to run 10 more samples. 

<b> Default Behavior </b>

Incremental random sampling is not used by default.  To change this
behavior, the \c incremental_random keyword must be specified in
conjuction with the \c sample_type keyword.  Additionally, a previous
random sampling study with sample size N must have already been
performed, and the dakota restart file must be available from this
previous study. The variables and responses specifications must be the
same in both studies.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

The incremental approach is useful if it is uncertain how many
simulations can be completed within available time.

Examples::

For example, say a user performs an initial study using \c random as
the \c sample_type, and generates 50 samples. If the user creates a
new input file where \c samples is 50, the \c sample_type is defined
to be \c incremental_random, and \c refinement_samples is specified to
be 10, the user will get 10 new random samples.  The M new samples
will be combined with the N previous samples to generate a combined
sample of size M+N.

The method block for the incremented study would be the following:
\verbatim
method
  sampling
    sample_type incremental_random
    samples = 50
      refinement_samples = 10
\endverbatim
The syntax for
running the second sample set is: 
\verbatim 
dakota -i input2.in -r dakota.rst
\endverbatim
where \c input2.in is the file which specifies
incremental sampling and dakota.rst is the restart
file containing the results of the previous study.
