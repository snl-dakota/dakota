Initial step size for non-gradient based optimizers
Description::
If \c initial_delta is supplied by the user, it will be applied in an
absolute sense in all coordinate directions. APPS documentation
advocates choosing \c initial_delta to be the approximate distance
from the initial point to the solution. If this is unknown, it is
advisable to err on the side of choosing an \c initial_delta that is
too large or to not specify it. In the latter case, APPS will take a
full step to the boundary in each direction. Relative application of
\c initial_delta is not available unless the user scales the problem
accordingly.
