Global Surrogate Based Optimization
Description::
The \c surrogate_based_global specification must identify:
\li a sub-method, using either \ref method-surrogate_based_global-method_pointer
    or \ref method-surrogate_based_global-method_name
\li \ref method-surrogate_based_global-model_pointer must be used to identify a surrogate model

\c surrogate_based_global works in an iterative scheme where
optimization is performed on a global surrogate using the same bounds
during each iteration.
\li In one iteration, the optimal solutions of the surrogate
model are found, and then a selected set of these optimal surrogate
solutions are passed to the next iteration. 
\li At the next iteration,
these surrogate points are evaluated with the "truth" model, and then
these points are added back to the set of points upon which the next
surrogate is constructed. 

In this way, the optimization acts on a more accurate surrogate during
each iteration, presumably driving to optimality quickly.
  
<em>Known Issue: When using discrete variables, there have been
sometimes significant differences in surrogate behavior observed
across computing platforms in some cases.  The cause has not yet been
fully diagnosed and is currently under investigation.  In addition,
guidance on appropriate construction and use of surrogates with
discrete variables is under development.  In the meantime, users
should therefore be aware that there is a risk of inaccurate results
when using surrogates with discrete variables.</em>


<b> Method Independent Controls </b>

\li \ref method-surrogate_based_global-max_iterations is used as a stopping critierion (see note below)

<b> Notes </b>

We have some cautionary notes before using the surrogate-based global
method:
\li <b> This approach has no guarantee of convergence. </b>
\li One might first try a single minimization method coupled with a
surrogate model prior to using the surrogate-based global method.
This is essentially equivalent to setting \c max_iterations to 1 and
will allow one to get a sense of what surrogate types are the most
accurate to use for the problem.
\li Also note that one can specify that surrogates be built for all
primary functions and constraints or for only a subset of these
functions and constraints. This allows one to use a "truth" model
directly for some of the response functions, perhaps due to them being
much less expensive than other functions.
\li We initially recommend a small number of maximum iterations, such
as 3-5, to get a sense of how the optimization is evolving as the
surrogate gets updated. If it appears to be changing significantly,
then a larger number (used in combination with restart) may be needed.

Theory::
In surrogate-based optimization (SBO) and surrogate-based nonlinear
least squares (SBNLS), minimization occurs using a set of one or more
approximations, defined from a surrogate model, that are built and
periodically updated using data from a "truth" model. The surrogate
model can be a global data fit (e.g., regression or interpolation of
data generated from a design of computer experiments), a multipoint
approximation, a local Taylor Series expansion, or a model hierarchy
approximation (e.g., a low-fidelity simulation model), whereas the
truth model involves a high-fidelity simulation model. The goals of
surrogate-based methods are to reduce the total number of truth model
simulations and, in the case of global data fit surrogates, to smooth
noisy data with an easily navigated analytic function.

It was originally designed for MOGA (a multi-objective genetic
algorithm). Since genetic algorithms often need thousands or tens of
thousands of points to produce optimal or near-optimal solutions, the
use of surrogates can be helpful for reducing the truth model
evaluations. Instead of creating one set of surrogates for the
individual objectives and running the optimization algorithm on the
surrogate once, the idea is to select points along the (surrogate)
Pareto frontier, which can be used to supplement the existing points.

In this way, one does not need to use many points initially to get a
very accurate surrogate. The surrogate becomes more accurate as the
iterations progress.
