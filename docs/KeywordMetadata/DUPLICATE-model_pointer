Blurb::
Identifier for model block to be used by a method

Description::
The \c model_pointer is used to specify which \ref model block will be
used to perform the function evaluations needed by the Dakota method.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

If not specified, a Dakota method will use the last model block
parsed.  If specified, there must be a \ref model block in the Dakota
input file that has a corresponding \c id_model with the same name.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

When doing advanced analyses that involve using multiple methods and
multiple models, defining a \c model_pointer for each method is
imperative.

See \ref topic-block_pointer for details about pointers.
