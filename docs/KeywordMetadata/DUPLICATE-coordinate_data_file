Name of the file which stores the values of the independent coordinates for field data
Description::
Field data involves a field quantity or response that is dependent upon some 
quantity.  For example, temperature (the field response) might be dependent on time (the independent 
coordinate).  Another example is where acceleration (the field response) might be dependent on 
a spatial (x,y,z) location, in this case on three independent coordinates. 

The \c coordinate_data_file specifies the file which contains the actual coordinate values.  Note that the number of dimensions (the number of columns of the file) is defined by 
\c num_coordinates_per_field. 
The length of the file (e.g. the number of rows in the file) is defined by \c lengths.
If the length a particular field data response is very long (e.g. lengths = 10000), we 
recommend using this option.  It is  
easier to read the independent coordinates by reading a data file instead of 
specifying them with a coordinate list in the Dakota input file. However, an alternative 
to reading them from a file is to read them via \c coordinate_list.
