Blurb:: Return estimator performance as the final results of a UQ method

Description:: Instead of QoI moments and level mappings, return the
performance of the estimator in terms of its variance and aggregate
cost.  These metrics are targeted in the context of model tuning for
multifidelity UQ methods.

<b> Usage Tips </b>
Estimator variance can be minimized when total budget is specified.
Alternatively, total budget can be minimized when estimator accuracy
is specified.  This is managed by the nested model response mappings
that define the outer loop objective and constraints, akin to the RIA
and PMA formulations for optimization with local reliability (refer
to RBDO methods in Theory Manual).
