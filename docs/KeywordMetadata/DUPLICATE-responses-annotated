Blurb::
Selects annotated tabular file format for experiment data
Description::
An annotated tabular file is a whitespace-separated text file with one
leading header row of comments/column labels.  For experiment data
files, each subsequent row contains an experiment ID, followed by data
for configuration variables, observations, and/or observation errors,
depending on context.

*Default Behavior*

By default, Dakota imports tabular experiment data files in annotated
format.  The ``annotated`` keyword can be used to explicitly specify
this.

*Usage Tips*


- Prior to October 2011, calibration and surrogate data files were in free-form format. They now default to ``annotated`` format, though ``freeform`` remains an option.
- When importing tabular data, a warning will be generated if a specific number of data are expected, but extra is found and an error generated when there is insufficient data.
