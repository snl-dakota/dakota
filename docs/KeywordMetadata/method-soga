Single-objective Genetic Algorithm (a.k.a Evolutionary Algorithm)
Description::
\c soga stands for Single-objective Genetic Algorithm, which is a
global optimization method that supports general constraints and a
mixture of real and discrete variables. \c soga is part of the JEGA
library.

<b> Constraints </b>
\c soga can utilize linear constraints.

<b> Configuration </b>

The genetic algorithm configurations are:
-# fitness
-# replacement
-# convergence
-# initialization
-# crossover
-# mutation
-# population size

The pool of potential members is the current population and the
current set of offspring.  Choice of fitness assessors is strongly
related to the type of replacement algorithm being used and can have a
profound effect on the solutions selected for the next generation.


<b> Stopping Criteria </b>

The \c soga method respects the \c max_iterations and \c
max_function_evaluations method independent controls to provide
integer limits for the maximum number of generations and function
evaluations, respectively.

The algorithm also stops when convergence is reached. This involves
repeated assessment of the algorithm's progress in solving the
problem, until some criterion is met.


<b> Outputs </b>
The \c soga method respects the \c output method independent control
to vary the amount of information presented to the user during
execution.

The final results are written to the Dakota tabular output. Additional
information is also available - see the \c log_file and \c
print_each_pop keywords.

Theory::
The basic steps of the \c soga algorithm are as follows: 
<ol> 
  <li> Initialize the population
  <li> Evaluate the population (calculate the values of the objective function and constraints for each population member)
  <li> Loop until converged, or stopping criteria reached
  <ol>
    <li> Perform crossover
    <li> Perform mutation
    <li> Evaluate the new population 
    <li> Assess the fitness of each member in the population
    <li> Replace the population with members selected to continue in the next generation
    <li> Test for convergence
  </ol>
</ol>
