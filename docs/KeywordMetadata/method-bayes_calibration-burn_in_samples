Blurb::
Manually specify the burn in period for the MCMC chain.

Description::
The burn in period is the number of samples at the beginning of the MCMC chain 
that are discarded. The resulting chain is less dependent on the starting point
of the chain.
 
<b> Default Behavior </b>

If not specified, no MCMC samples are discarded

<b> Expected Output </b>

If \c burn_in_samples is specified, an additional tabular output file containing
the final MCMC chain is generated. 

Examples::
An example method block of a Dakota input file is given below

\verbatim
method,
	bayes_calibration queso
	  chain_samples = 1000 seed = 348
	  dram
	proposal_covariance
	  diagonal values 1.0e6 1.0e-1
	burn_in_samples 100
\endverbatim
