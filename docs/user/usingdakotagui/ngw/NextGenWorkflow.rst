The Dakota GUI includes a node-based workflow creation tool called "Next-Gen Workflow" (NGW from this point on).  NGW is an extremely useful standalone tool for building workflows
to process data, but it is primarily included as part of Dakota GUI to facilitate more complex Dakota analysis drivers.  With NGW, you can fully customize the flow of information
between Dakota and your simulation model using a series of nodes that are visually connected together.
