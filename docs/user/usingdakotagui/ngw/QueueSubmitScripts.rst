Next-Gen Workflow Queue Submit Scripts
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When submitting remote work to job queueing systems, most of the heavy lifting is performed by shell scripts that are executed on
the remote machine. As a result, you can control NGW's queue-submission nodes to a certain degree, simply by editing the scripts
provided with each node.
