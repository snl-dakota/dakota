Many popular programming languages have support, either natively or from a third-party library, for reading and writing HDF5 files. The HDF Group itself supports C/C++ and Java libraries. The Dakota Project suggests the `h5py` module for Python. Examples that demonstrate using `h5py` to access and use Dakota HDF5 output may be found in the Dakota installation at ``dakota/share/dakota/examples/official/hdf5``.
