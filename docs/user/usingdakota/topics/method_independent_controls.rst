Method-Independent Controls
===========================

The ``method independent controls`` are those controls which
are valid for a variety of methods. In some cases, these controls are
abstractions which may have slightly different implementations from
one method to the next.
While each of these controls is not
valid for every method, the controls are valid for enough methods that it was
reasonable to consolidate the
specifications.
