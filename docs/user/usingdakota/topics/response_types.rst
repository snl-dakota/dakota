Response Types
==============

The specification must be one of three types:


- objective and constraint functions
- calibration (least squares) terms and constraint functions
- a generic response functions specification.

These correspond to (a) optimization, (b) deterministic (least
squares) or stochastic (Bayesian) inversion, and (c) general-purpose
analyzer methods such as parameter studies, DACE, and UQ methods,
respectively.  Refer to :dakkw:`responses` for additional details and
examples.
