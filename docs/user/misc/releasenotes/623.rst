**Highlight: Compute statistics from imported samples**

Version 6.23 includes improved support for computing statistics
from imported samples. The :dakkw:`method-import_points` method
reads samples from a tabular file and computes moments, correlation
coefficients, and, optionally, level mappings and Sobol indices.

*Enabling / Accessing:* The :dakkw:`method-import_samples` method is
available in all builds of Dakota.

*Documentation:* 

The keyword documentation for the :dakkw:`method-import_points`
method has further details.

**Highlight: Import methods from Python**

Dakota can now import and use methods written in Python. Users can
implement or wrap their own iterative, black-box algorithms such as 
optimizers or UQ methods and use them in Dakota studies. Dakota
provides the imported method with a wrapped Model instance that it can
use to evaluate the function, gradient, and Hessian of responses and
perform other operations such as sending results to Dakota's output
stream.

*Enabling / Accessing:* The :dakkw:`method-external_python` method is
available in all builds of Dakota.

*Documentation:* 

The keyword documentation for the :dakkw:`method-external_python`
method has further details.

**Miscellaneous Enhancements and Bugfixes**

- Windows builds now performed using MSVS 2022 and Intel oneAPI 2024.
- Fix for `github 140 <http://github.com/snl-dakota/dakota/issues/140>`_
  by replacing boost::filesystem with std::filesystem
- Obviates `github PR179 <https://github.com/snl-dakota/dakota/pull/179>`_
  and `github PR181 <https://github.com/snl-dakota/dakota/pull/181>`_
- Method source and interval type keywords for numerical gradients are 
  now properly nested.
- Dakota reports the options it was configured with when the
  `-version` command line argument is followed by `all` or a search
  string.

**Compatibility**

- Dakota now requires a minimum of Boost 1.70.
