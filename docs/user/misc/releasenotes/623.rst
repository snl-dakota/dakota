**Highlight: Compute statistics from imported samples**

A new method, :dakkw:`method-import_points`, is available in Dakota
release 6.23. It simplifies importing input-output points from
a tabular file and computing statistics for them. Computed
statistics include correlation coefficients, moments, and optionally
level mappings and Sobol indices.

*Enabling / Accessing:* The :dakkw:`method-import_samples` method is
available in all builds of Dakota.

*Documentation:* 

The keyword documentation for the :dakkw:`method-import_points`
method has further details.

**Highlight: External Python method support**

A new interface for general python methods,
:dakkw:`method-external_python`, is available in Dakota release 6.23. It
enables python implementations of the Dakota Iterator and provides a
wrapped Dakota model for function, gradient and hessian responses along
with helper methods to query model properties and output results to the
Dakota output stream.
