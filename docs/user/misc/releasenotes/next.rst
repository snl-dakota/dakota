The Dakota GUI has added many significant feature improvements over
the last year.  The Dakota GUI now allows you to seamlessly browse
Dakota's HDF5 database output files, as well as generate sophisticated
graphical plots from HDF5 data with just a few clicks.  HDF5 browsing
and plot generation can also be driven within Dakota GUI by Next-Gen
Workflow, a powerful tool that allows you to construct node-based
workflows for complex tasks.

*Enabling / Accessing:* Dakota GUI ships with Dakota and is available
for Windows, Mac, and RHEL7.

*Documentation:* An enhanced version of the Dakota GUI manual now ships
with the GUI, giving you easy access to a wealth of reference material
for using the GUI.  The 6.11 GUI manual is also available here.
