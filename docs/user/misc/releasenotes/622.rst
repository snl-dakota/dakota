**Improvements by Category**

*Interfaces, Input/Output*

- The :ref:`pyprepro template processing <interfaces:dprepro-and-pyprepro>` tool now supports
  :ref:`JSON format Dakota parameters files <variables:parameters:json>`.

*Optimization Methods*

- :dakkw:`ROL optimizer <method-rol>` was updated to release 2.0.

*UQ Methods*

- Support for MUQ's :dakkw:`multilevel MCMC algorithm <method-bayes_calibration-muq-multilevel_mcmc>` was added.
- When performing sampling-based multifidelity UQ with multiple QoIs, the
  target metric used to determine sample allocations may now be specified.
  Options for the average over the QoIs, the maximum, and the p-norm
  are provided. See, e.g., for the 
  :dakkw:`multifelity estimator<method-multifidelity_sampling-numerical_solve-solver_metric>`.
- Weighted MLMC sampling now accepts specification of an 
  :dakkw:`optimization strategy <method-multilevel_sampling-weighted>`.
