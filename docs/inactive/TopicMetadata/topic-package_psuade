The Problem Solving Environment for Uncertainty Analysis and Design
Exploration (PSUADE) is a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory tool
for metamodeling, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification,
and optimization. Its features include non-intrusive and parallel
function evaluations, sampling and analysis methods, an integrated
design and analysis framework, global optimization, numerical
integration, response surfaces (MARS and higher order regressions),
graphical output with Pgplot or Matlab, and fault tolerance
