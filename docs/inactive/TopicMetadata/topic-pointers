For all pointer specifications, if a pointer string is specified and no
corresponding id string is available, %Dakota will exit with an error message. 

If the pointer is optional and no pointer string is specified,
then the last specification parsed will be used. 

It is appropriate to omit optional cross-referencing whenever the
relationships are unambiguous due to the presence of only one specification.
