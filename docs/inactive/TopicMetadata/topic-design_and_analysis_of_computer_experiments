Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DACE) methods compute
response data sets at a selection of points in the parameter space.
Three libraries are provided for performing these studies: DDACE, 
FSUDace, and PSUADE. The design of experiments methods do not
currently make use of any of the method independent controls.
