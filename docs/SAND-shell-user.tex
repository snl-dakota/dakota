% This document is a shell for generating a SAND report from the Users Manual
% generated using a doxygen-consistent style.  It uses \includepdf from the
% pdfpages package to embed the Manual, but cannot currently preserve the
% original hyperlinking.  Therefore, it is currently restricted to report
% printing, and should not be used for electronic documents.

% Rather than adopting the SAND report class for the entire manual, we include
% the doxygen-consistent Users Manual within a SAND report shell.  The first two
% pages of Users_Main.pdf have their own title page, such that the document can
% stand alone.  For SAND report preparation, we omit the first two pages by
% including 3-end.  The page numbering matches up since we set the page counter
% to 3 for the title page in Users_Main.tex.
