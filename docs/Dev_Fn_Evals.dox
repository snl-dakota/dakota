Performing function evaluations is one of the most critical functions
of the %Dakota software.  It can also be one of the most complicated,
as a variety of scheduling approaches and parallelism levels are
supported.  This complexity manifests itself in the code through a
series of cascaded member functions, from the top level model
evaluation functions, through various scheduling routines, to the low
level details of performing a system call, fork, or direct function
invocation.  This section provides an overview of the primary classes
and member functions involved.


\section FnEvalsSynch Synchronous function evaluations


For a synchronous (i.e., blocking) mapping of parameters to responses,
an iterator invokes 
\ref Model::evaluate "Model::evaluate()" to 
perform a function evaluation.  This function is all that is seen from the
iterator level, as underlying complexities are isolated.  The binding
of this top level function with lower level functions is as follows:
<ul>
<li> \ref Model::evaluate "Model::evaluate()" utilizes 
\ref Model::derived_evaluate "Model::derived_evaluate()"
for portions of the response computation specific to derived model classes.
<li> \ref 
Model::derived_evaluate "Model::derived_evaluate()" 
directly or indirectly invokes \ref Interface::map "Interface::map()".
<li> \ref Interface::map "Interface::map()" utilizes \ref 
ApplicationInterface::derived_map "ApplicationInterface::derived_map()"
for portions of the mapping specific to derived application interface classes.
</ul>


\section FnEvalsAsynch Asynchronous function evaluations


For an asynchronous (i.e., nonblocking) mapping of parameters to
responses, an iterator invokes \ref 
Model::evaluate_nowait "Model::evaluate_nowait()"
multiple times to queue asynchronous jobs and then invokes either
\ref Model::synchronize "Model::synchronize()" or \ref
Model::synchronize_nowait "Model::synchronize_nowait()" to
schedule the queued jobs in blocking or nonblocking fashion.  Again,
these functions are all that is seen from the iterator level, as
underlying complexities are isolated.  The binding of these top level
functions with lower level functions is as follows:
<ul>
<li> \ref Model::evaluate_nowait "Model::evaluate_nowait()"
utilizes \ref
Model::derived_evaluate_nowait "Model::derived_evaluate_nowait()"
for portions of the response computation specific to derived model classes.
<li> This derived model class function directly or indirectly 
invokes \ref Interface::map "Interface::map()" in asynchronous mode, 
which adds the job to a scheduling queue.
<li> \ref Model::synchronize "Model::synchronize()" or \ref
Model::synchronize_nowait "Model::synchronize_nowait()"
utilize \ref Model::derived_synchronize "Model::derived_synchronize()"
or \ref 
Model::derived_synchronize_nowait "Model::derived_synchronize_nowait()"
for portions of the scheduling process specific to derived model classes.
<li> These derived model class functions directly or indirectly invoke 
\ref Interface::synch "Interface::synch()" or 
\ref Interface::synch_nowait "Interface::synch_nowait()".
<li> For application interfaces, these interface synchronization
functions are responsible for performing evaluation scheduling in 
one of the following modes: master dynamic, peer dynamic or peer static.
<!--
  <ul>
  <li> asynchronous local mode (using 
\ref ApplicationInterface::asynchronous_local_evaluations "ApplicationInterface::asynchronous_local_evaluations()" or 
\ref ApplicationInterface::asynchronous_local_evaluations_nowait "ApplicationInterface::asynchronous_local_evaluations_nowait()")
  <li> message passing mode (using
\ref ApplicationInterface::self_schedule_evaluations "ApplicationInterface::self_schedule_evaluations()" or 
\ref ApplicationInterface::static_schedule_evaluations "ApplicationInterface::static_schedule_evaluations()"
  on the iterator master and 
\ref ApplicationInterface::serve_evaluations_synch "ApplicationInterface::serve_evaluations_synch()" or 
\ref ApplicationInterface::serve_evaluations_synch_peer "ApplicationInterface::serve_evaluations_synch_peer()" on the servers)
  <li> hybrid mode (using 
\ref ApplicationInterface::self_schedule_evaluations "ApplicationInterface::self_schedule_evaluations()" or 
\ref ApplicationInterface::static_schedule_evaluations "ApplicationInterface::static_schedule_evaluations()"
  on the iterator master and 
\ref ApplicationInterface::serve_evaluations_asynch "ApplicationInterface::serve_evaluations_asynch()" or 
\ref ApplicationInterface::serve_evaluations_asynch_peer "ApplicationInterface::serve_evaluations_asynch_peer()" or 
  on the servers)
  </ul>
<li> These scheduling functions utilize
\ref ApplicationInterface::derived_map "ApplicationInterface::derived_map()" and
\ref ApplicationInterface::derived_map_asynch "ApplicationInterface::derived_map_asynch()"
for portions of asynchronous job launching specific to derived application 
interface classes, as well as 
\ref ApplicationInterface::derived_synch "ApplicationInterface::derived_synch()" and
\ref ApplicationInterface::derived_synch_nowait "ApplicationInterface::derived_synch_nowait()"
for portions of job capturing specific to derived application interface classes.

\section FnEvalsAnalyses Analyses within each function evaluation

<em>NOTE: The Interface evaluation scheduling in %Dakota was refactored
for releases 5.4 and 6.0.  Discussion of the new Interface-related
functions for analyses is currently missing here.</em>

The discussion above covers the parallelism level of concurrent 
function evaluations serving an iterator.  For the parallelism 
level of concurrent analyses serving a function evaluation, similar 
schedulers are involved 
<!-- TODO
(\ref 
ForkApplicInterface::synchronous_local_analyses "ForkApplicInterface::synchronous_local_analyses()",
\ref ForkApplicInterface::asynchronous_local_analyses "ForkApplicInterface::asynchronous_local_analyses()",
\ref ApplicationInterface::self_schedule_analyses "ApplicationInterface::self_schedule_analyses()",
\ref ApplicationInterface::serve_analyses_synch "ApplicationInterface::serve_analyses_synch()",
\ref ForkApplicInterface::serve_analyses_asynch "ForkApplicInterface::serve_analyses_asynch()")
-->
to support synchronous local, asynchronous local, message passing, and
hybrid modes.  Not all of the schedulers are elevated to the
ApplicationInterface level since the system call and direct function
interfaces do not yet support nonblocking local analyses (and
therefore support synchronous local and message passing modes, but not
asynchronous local or hybrid modes).  Fork interfaces, however,
support all modes of analysis parallelism.
