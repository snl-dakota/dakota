Blurb::
Construct moving least squares surrogate over active subspace
Description::
Once the active subspace variables have been identified, replace the
fullspace truth model with a moving least squares surrogate model over
the reduced variables.  The surrogate is constructed using the
fullspace function value samples collected during subspace
identification, possibly supplemented with additional
:dakkw:`model-active_subspace-build_surrogate-refinement_samples` in the
fullspace.

*Default Behavior*

No surrogate is constructed by default.
