Blurb::
Parameter for the Multi-level MCMC algorithm in MUQ

Description::
The greedy algorithm used in MUQ drives the MLMCMC such that the variance at each level is recomputed very frequently.
The ``greedy_resampling_factor`` allows to avoid recomputing variances too frequently by defining the fraction of samples to reuse before recomputing.

*Default Behavior*

Defaults to 0.5.

Topics::
bayesian_calibration
