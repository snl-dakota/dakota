For weighted multilevel Monte Carlo, this option activates a search over possible hierarchical model graphs

Description::
Referring to :dakkw:`method-approximate_control_variate-acv_recursive_diff`,
weighted MLMC is a special case of ACV-RD, resulting in a forward to
the generalized ACV solver for the case of a fixed hierarchical DAG.

While the use of a hierarchical DAG is required in MLMC, the approximation
selections and orderings within this DAG can be varied, so generalized
ACV capabilities for model graph search (see
:dakkw:`method-multilevel_sampling-weighted-search_model_graphs-full_recursion`)
and model selection (see
:dakkw:`method-multilevel_sampling-weighted-search_model_graphs-model_selection`)
are available.

Examples::
Note that the default for weighted MLMC is no search,

.. code-block::

method,
        multilevel_sampling
	  pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
	  weighted
	  max_function_evaluations = 500

with options to activate search over model ordering,

.. code-block::

method,
        multilevel_sampling
	  pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
	  weighted
	    search_model_graphs full_recursion
	  max_function_evaluations = 500

over model subset selection,

.. code-block::

method,
        multilevel_sampling
	  pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
	  weighted
	    search_model_graphs no_recursion model_selection
	  max_function_evaluations = 500

or over both.

.. code-block::

method,
        multilevel_sampling
	  pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
	  weighted
	    search_model_graphs full_recursion model_selection
	  max_function_evaluations = 500
