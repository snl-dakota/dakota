Blurb::
Specify which variables block will be included with this model block
Description::
The ``variables_pointer`` is used to specify which variables block will be used
by the model, by cross-referencing with :dakkw:`variables-id_variables` keyword in
the :dakkw:`variables` block.

See :ref:`topic-block_pointer` for details about pointers.

*Default Behavior*

When a variables pointer is not specified, the model will use the last
variables block parsed from the input file.
