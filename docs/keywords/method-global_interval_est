Interval analysis using global optimization methods
Description::
In the global approach to interval estimation, one uses either a global optimization
method or a sampling method to assess the bounds of the responses.

``global_interval_est``
allows the user to specify several approaches to calculate
interval bounds on the output responses.

- ``lhs`` - note: this takes the minimum and maximum of the samples as the bounds
- ``ego``
- ``sbo``
- ``ea``
