Define coefficients of the linear equalities

Description::
In the equality case, the constraint matrix :math:`A` 
provides coefficients for the variables on the left hand side of:

.. math:: Ax = a_t

The linear_constraints topics page (linked above) outlines a few additional
things to consider when using linear constraints.

Topics::
linear_constraints

Examples::
An optimization involving three variables, ``x1``, ``x2``, and ``x3``, is to be
performed. These variables must satisfy a pair of linear equality constraints:

.. math::  1.5 \cdot x1 + 1.0 \cdot x2 = 5.0 
.. math::  3.0 \cdot x1 - 4.0 \cdot x3 = 0.0 

The pair of constraints can be written in matrix form as:

.. math::
   \begin{bmatrix}
   1.5 & 1.0 & 0.0 \\
   3.0 & 0.0 & -4.0
   \end{bmatrix}
   \begin{bmatrix}
   x1 \\
   x2 \\
   x3
   \end{bmatrix}
   =
   \begin{bmatrix}
   5.0 \\
   0.0
   \end{bmatrix}


The coefficient matrix and right hand side are expressed to Dakota in the
:dakkw:`variables` section of the input file:

.. code-block::
    
    variables
      continuous_design 2
        descriptors 'x1' 'x2'
    
      linear_equality_constraint_matrix = 1.5  1.0  0.0
                                          3.0  0.0 -4.0
    
      linear_equality_targets = 5.0
                                0.0
