Use the surrogate based optimization method
Description::
A surrogate-based optimization method will be used.  The surrogate
employed in ``sbo`` is a Gaussian process surrogate.

The main difference between ``ego`` and the
``sbo`` approach is the objective function being optimized.
``ego`` relies on an expected improvement function, while in
``sbo``, the optimization proceeds using an evolutionary
algorithm ( :dakkw:`method-coliny_ea`) on the Gaussian process surrogate:
it is a standard surrogate-based optimization. Also note that the
``sbo`` option can support optimization over discrete variables (the
discrete variables are relaxed) while ``ego`` cannot.

This is not the same as :dakkw:`method-surrogate_based_global`.
