Blurb::
A conjugate gradient optimization method
Description::
The conjugate gradient method is an implementation of the
Polak-Ribiere approach and handles only unconstrained problems.

See :ref:`topic-package_optpp` for info related to all ``optpp`` methods.

*Expected HDF5 Output*

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the
:dakkw:`environment-results_output-hdf5` keyword, this method
writes the following results to HDF5:


- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_params`
- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_obj_fncs` (when :dakkw:`responses-objective_functions`) are specified)
- :ref:`hdf5_results-calibration` (when :dakkw:`responses-calibration_terms` are specified)
