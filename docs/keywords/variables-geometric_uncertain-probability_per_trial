Description::

The geometric distribution represents the number of successful trials
that occur before a failure is observed. The density function for the
geometric distribution is given by:

.. math:: f(x) = {p}{(1-p)^{x}}

where ``p`` is the probability of failure per trial and ``x`` is the
number of successful trials.
