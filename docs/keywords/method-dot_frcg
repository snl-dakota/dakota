DOT conjugate gradient optimization method
Description::
DOT library :cite:p:`Van95` implementation of Fletcher-Reeves conjugate
gradient method for unconstrained optimizaiton.

See :ref:`topic-package_dot` for information common to all ``DOT`` methods.

*DOT requires a separate software license and therefore may not
be available in all versions of Dakota.  CONMIN or OPT++ methods may
be suitable alternatives.*

.. warning::
    In DOT
    Version 4.20, we have noticed inconsistent behavior of this algorithm
    across different versions of Linux. Our best assessment is that it is
    due to different treatments of uninitialized variables. As we do not
    know the intention of the code authors and maintaining DOT source code
    is outside of the Dakota project scope, we have not made nor are we
    recommending any code changes to address this. However, all users who
    use ``dot_frcg`` in DOT Version 4.20 should be aware that
    results may not be reliable.
    
*Expected HDF5 Output*

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the
:dakkw:`environment-results_output-hdf5` keyword, this method
writes the following results to HDF5:


- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_params`
- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_obj_fncs` (when :dakkw:`responses-objective_functions`) are specified)
- :ref:`hdf5_results-calibration` (when :dakkw:`responses-calibration_terms` are specified)
