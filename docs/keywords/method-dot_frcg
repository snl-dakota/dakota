DOT conjugate gradient optimization method
Description::
DOT library :cite:p:`Van95` implementation of Fletcher-Reeves conjugate
gradient method for unconstrained optimizaiton.

See :ref:`topic-package_dot<topic-package_dot>` for information common to all ``DOT`` methods.

*DOT requires a separate software license and therefore may not
be available in all versions of Dakota.  CONMIN or OPT++ methods may
be suitable alternatives.*

*Caution regarding ``dot_frcg``.* In DOT
Version 4.20, we have noticed inconsistent behavior of this algorithm
across different versions of Linux. Our best assessment is that it is
due to different treatments of uninitialized variables. As we do not
know the intention of the code authors and maintaining DOT source code
is outside of the Dakota project scope, we have not made nor are we
recommending any code changes to address this. However, all users who
use ``dot_frcg`` in DOT Version 4.20 should be aware that
results may not be reliable.

*Expected HDF5 Output*

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the
:ref:`environment-results_output-hdf5<environment-results_output-hdf5>` keyword, this method
writes the following results to HDF5:


- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_params`
- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_obj_fncs` (when :ref:`responses-objective_functions<responses-objective_functions>`) are specified)
- :ref:`hdf5_results-calibration` (when :ref:`responses-calibration_terms<responses-calibration_terms>` are specified)
