Use a hybrid global-local scheme for solving an optimization sub-problem

Description::
This sub-problem solver option employs multiple methods, both
sequenced and competed.  It is currently the most comprehensive (and
expensive) option.  First, the sequence is from a global subproblem
solve, followed by competed local solves that are initiated from the
best global solution.  The global solver is DIRECT and the competed
local solves are sequentual quadratic programming (``sqp``) and
nonlinear interior point (``nip``), from NSPOL and OPT++ respectively.
