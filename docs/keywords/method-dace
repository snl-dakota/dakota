Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments
Description::
The Distributed Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DDACE)
library provides the following DACE techniques:

#. grid sampling ( ``grid``)
#. pure random sampling ( ``random``)
#. orthogonal array sampling ( ``oas``)
#. latin hypercube sampling ( ``lhs``)
#. orthogonal array latin hypercube sampling ( ``oa_lhs``)
#. Box-Behnken ( ``box_behnken``)
#. central composite design ( ``central_composite``)

These methods all generate point sets that may be used to drive a set of
computer experiments.  Note that all of the DACE methods generated
randomized designs, except for Box-Behnken and Central composite which
are classical designs.  That is, the grid sampling will generate a
randomized grid, not what one typically thinks of as a grid
of uniformly spaced points over a rectangular grid.  Similar,
the orthogonal array is a randomized version of an orthogonal
array:  it does not generate discrete, fixed levels.

In addition to the selection of the method, there are keywords
that affect the method outputs:

#. :dakkw:`method-dace-main_effects`
#. :dakkw:`method-dace-quality_metrics`
#. :dakkw:`method-dace-variance_based_decomp`

And keywords that affect the sampling:

#. :dakkw:`method-dace-fixed_seed`
#. :dakkw:`method-dace-symbols`
#. :dakkw:`method-dace-samples`
#. :dakkw:`method-dace-seed`
