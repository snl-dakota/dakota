Blurb::
Throttle multilevel BLUE to only solve for allocations using groups with prescribed conditioning in their group covariances

Description::
The number of groups in ML BLUE is initially defined using all
combinations of the model indices, and group covariances are computed
for every group.  This throttle then retains only the groups for which
the group covariances have an inverse condition number ("rcond")
greater than the provided tolerance.  This is closely related to
:dakkw:`method-multilevel_blue-group_throttle-best_conditioned` except
that the number of retained groups is not known a priori.
