CONMIN conjugate gradient optimization method
Description::
The interpretations of the method independent controls for CONMIN are
essentially identical to those for DOT.

See :ref:`topic-package_dot` for information related to ``CONMIN``
methods, specifically :dakkw:`method-dot_frcg`.

*Expected HDF5 Output*

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the
:dakkw:`environment-results_output-hdf5` keyword, this method
writes the following results to HDF5:


- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_params`
- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_obj_fncs` (when :dakkw:`responses-objective_functions`) are specified)
- :ref:`hdf5_results-calibration` (when :dakkw:`responses-calibration_terms` are specified)
