Blurb::
Reduce the number of groups in multilevel BLUE using a throttle

Description::
The number of groups in ML BLUE is, by default, determined by all
combinations of the model indices, spanning the truth model and all
approximations.  This combinatorial growth quickly results in very
large group counts as the number of model approximations grows.  This
number of combinations may be optionally throttled using one of the
following schemes: ``mfmc_groups``, ``common_groups``, or
``group_size``.

*Default Behavior*

The default is no throttle: all model combinations are included.
