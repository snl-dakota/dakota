Exports surrogate model in user-specified format(s)
Description::
Export the surrogate for later re-import to Dakota or evaluation using
the surfpack exectuable ( ``bin/surfpack``) or a user-developed
tool. Export format is controlled using the ``formats``
specification. Four formats are available in Dakota; however, not all
have been enabled for all surrogates.

The four formats are:


- ``text_archive`` - Plain-text, machine-readable archive for re-import or use with the surfpack executable

- ``binary_archive`` - Binary, machine-readable archive for re-import or use with the surfpack executable

- ``algebraic_file`` - Plain-text, human-readable file intended for use with user-created tools; not compatible with Dakota or the surfpack executable

- ``algebraic_console`` - Print the model in algebraic format to the screen; not compatible with Dakota or the surfpack executable


These global surrogates can be exported in all four formats:


- Gaussian process (keyword ``gaussian_process`` surfpack)

- Artificial neural network (keyword ``neural_network``)

- Radial basis Funtions (keyword ``radial_basis``)

- Polynomial (keyword ``polynomial``)


However, for experimental Gaussian Process and polynomial models as
well as Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (keyword ``mars``) and
moving least squares (keyword ``moving_least_squares``) models, only
``text_archive`` and ``binary_archive`` formats may be used.

Currently, no other surrogate models can be exported.

*Default Behavior*

No export.

*Expected Output*

Output depends on selected format; see the ``formats`` specification.

*Additional Discussion*

The Dakota examples include a demonstration of using the surfpack
executable with an exported model file.
