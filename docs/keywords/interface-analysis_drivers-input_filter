Run a pre-processing script before the analysis drivers
Description::
The
optional ``input_filter`` and ``output_filter`` specifications provide
the names of separate pre- and post-processing programs or scripts
which assist in mapping Dakota parameters files into analysis input
files and mapping analysis output files into Dakota results files,
respectively.

If there is only a single analysis driver, then it is
usually most convenient to combine pre- and post-processing
requirements into a single analysis driver script and omit the
separate input and output filters. However, in the case of multiple
analysis drivers, the input and output filters provide a convenient
location for non-repeated pre- and post-processing requirements. That
is, input and output filters are only executed once per function
evaluation, regardless of the number of analysis drivers, which makes
them convenient locations for data processing operations that are
shared among the analysis drivers.

The :dakkw:`interface-analysis_drivers-fork-verbatim` keyword applies
to input and output filters as well as analysis drivers, and Dakota
also will substitute the names of the parameters and results files for the
tokens `{PARAMETERS}` and `{RESULTS}` in input and output filer strings,
as explained in the documentation for :dakkw:`interface-analysis_drivers`.
