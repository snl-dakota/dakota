Enable constraint relaxation
Description::
The command ``constraint_relax`` followed by a method name specifies
the type of relaxation to be used. Currently, ``homotopy``
:cite:p:`Per04a` is the only available method for
constraint relaxation, and this method is dependent on the presence of
the NPSOL library within the Dakota executable.
