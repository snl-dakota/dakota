Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms from the MUQ package
Description::
The ``muq`` method supports the following MCMC algorithms:
adaptive metropolis (AM), Metropolis Hasting (MH), delayed
rejection (DR), delayed-rejection adaptive metropolis (DRAM),
Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA), dimension-independent
likelihood-informed (DILI), and multi-level MCMC.

The ``muq`` method is currently an experimental method that relies
on algorithms from MIT's MUQ code documented at:
