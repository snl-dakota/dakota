Sequence of collocation point counts used in a multi-stage expansion
Description::
Each level entry of the ``collocation_points_sequence`` applies to one
expansion within a multi-stage expansion.  Current multi-stage
expansions that support collocation point sequences include multilevel
and multifidelity polynomial chaos and multilevel and multifidelity
function train expansions.

If adaptive refinement is active, then this sequence specifies the
starting point for each level within either an individual or
integrated refinement approach.

A corresponding scalar specification is documented at, e.g.,
