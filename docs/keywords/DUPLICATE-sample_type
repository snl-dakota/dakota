Selection of sampling strategy
Description::
The ``sample_type`` keyword allows the user to select between two types
of sampling: Monte Carlo (pure random) and Latin hypercube
(stratified) sampling.

The incremental keywords are deprecated; instead use ``samples``
together with ``refinement_samples``.

*Default Behavior*

If the ``sample_type`` keyword is present, it must be accompanied by
``lhs`` or ``random``.  In most contexts, ``lhs`` is the 
default (exception: multilevel_sampling uses Monte Carlo by default).
