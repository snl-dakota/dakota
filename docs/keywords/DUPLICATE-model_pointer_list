Associate models with method names
Description::
Using the optional keyword ``model_pointer_list``, models can be assigned to
methods specified in the ``method_name_list``. Models are referred to by name
(i.e. by their :dakkw:`model-id_model` labels). The length of the
``model_pointer_list`` must be either 1 or match the length
of the ``method_name_list``. If the former, the same model will be
used for all methods, and if the latter, methods and models will be paired in
the order that they appear in the two lists.
