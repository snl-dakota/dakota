The base name of the work directory created by Dakota
Description::
The ``named`` keyword is followed by a string, indicating the name of
the work directory created by Dakota.  If relative, the work directory
will be created relative to the directory from which Dakota is
invoked.

If ``named`` is not used, the default work directory is a temporary
directory with a system-generated name (e.g.,
``/tmp/dakota_work_c93vb71z/``).
