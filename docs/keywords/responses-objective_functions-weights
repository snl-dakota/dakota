Specify weights for each objective function
Description::
For multi-objective optimization problems (where the number of
objective functions is greater than 1), then a ``weights``
specification provides a simple weighted-sum approach to combining
multiple objectives into a single objective: 

.. math:: f = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{i}f_{i}

Length: The ``weights`` must have length equal to
:dakkw:`responses-objective_functions`. Thus, when scalar and/or field
responses are specified, the number of ``weights`` must equal the
number of scalars plus the number of fields, *not* the total elements
in the fields.

*Default Behavior* If weights are not specified, then each
response is given equal weighting: 

.. math:: f = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{f_i}{n}

where, in both of these cases, a "minimization"
:dakkw:`responses-objective_functions-sense` will retain a positive weighting
for a minimizer and a "maximization" sense will apply a negative
weighting.

*Usage Tips:*

Weights are applied as multipliers, scales as charateristic values /
divisors.

When scaling is active, it is applied to objective functions prior to
any ``weights`` and multi-objective sum formation. See the equations in
:dakkw:`responses-objective_functions`.
