Blurb::
Metric employed during numerical solutions in sampling-based multifidelity UQ methods.

Description::
For sampling-based multifidelity UQ methods, this specification
selects the metric to be used during numerical solutions for sample
allocations per model.  When there are multiple quantities of interest
(QoI), the vector of QoI estimator variances needs to be converted to
a scalar for use by the numerical solver.  Options include the
average, maximum, and p-norm of the QoI vector, with the default of
average estimator variance.
