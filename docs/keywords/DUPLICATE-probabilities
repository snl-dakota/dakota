Computes probabilities associated with response levels
Description::
The ``probabilities`` keyword directs Dakota to compute the probability that the model response will be below (cumulative) or above (complementary cumulative) a specified response value.  This is done for every response level designated for each response.

*Default Behavior*

If ``response_levels`` is specified, the probabilities are computed by default.  To explicitly specify it in the Dakota input file, though, the ``probabilities`` keyword should be specified in conjunction with the ``compute`` keyword.

*Expected Outputs*

The Dakota output is a set of response level-probability pairs that give the probability that the model response will be below or above the corresponding response level, depending on the distribution defined.
