Multifidelity sampling methods for UQ
Description::
An adaptive sampling method that utilizes multifidelity
relationships in order to improve efficiency through variance reduction.

Two variants are currently supported, with the former now deprecated
and to be replaced by the latter:

- In the case of a hierarchical surrogate model, the two-model approach of Ng and Willcox (2014) is supported and the two most extreme model fidelities or resolutions are employed as the truth model and approximation model.

- In the case of a non-hierarchical surrogate model, the multi-model approach of Peherstorfer et al. (2016) is supported for which all model instances can be integrated into the scheme. Both methods can be used with either a model form sequence or a resolution level sequence.

*Control Variate Monte Carlo*

In the case of two model fidelities (low fidelity denoted as LF and
high fidelity denoted as HF), we employ a control variate approach as
described in Ng and Willcox (2014):


.. math::  \hat{Q}_{HF}^{CV} = \hat{Q}_{HF}^{MC}
   - \beta (\hat{Q}_{LF}^{MC} - \mathbb{E}[Q_{LF}]) 

As opposed to the traditional control variate approach, we do not know
:math:`\mathbb{E}[Q_{LF}]`  precisely, but rather we estimate it more
accurately than :math:`\hat{Q}_{LF}^{MC}`  based on a sampling increment
applied to the LF model.  This sampling increment is based again on
a total cost minimization procedure that incorporates the relative LF
and HF costs and the observed Pearson correlation coefficient
:math:`\rho_{LH}`  between :math:`Q_{LF}`  and :math:`Q_{HF}` .  The
coefficient :math:`\beta`  is then determined from the observed LF-HF
covariance and LF variance.

*Multifidelity Monte Carlo*

This approach can be extended to a sequence of low-fidelity
approximations using a recusive sampling approach as in Peherstorfer
et al. (2016).


.. math::  \hat{Q}_{HF}^{CV} = \hat{Q}_{HF}^{MC}
   - \sum_{i=1}^M \beta_i (\hat{Q}_{LF_i}^{MC} - \mathbb{E}[Q_{LF_i}]) 

In this case, the variance in the estimate of the :math:`i^{th}`  control
mean is reduced by the :math:`(i+1)^{th}`  control variate, such that the
variance reduction is limited by the case of an exact estimate of the
first control mean (referred to as OCV-1 in Gorodetsky et al., 2020).

*Default Behavior*

The ``multifidelity_sampling`` method employs Monte Carlo sample sets by
default, but this default can be overridden to use Latin hypercube
sample sets using ``sample_type`` ``lhs``.

*Expected Output*

The ``multifidelity_sampling`` method reports estimates of the first four
moments and a summary of the evaluations performed for each model
fidelity and discretization level.  The method does not support any
level mappings (response, probability, reliability, generalized
reliability) at this time.

*Expected HDF5 Output*

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the
:ref:`environment-results_output-hdf5<environment-results_output-hdf5>` keyword, this method
writes the following results to HDF5:


- :ref:`hdf5_results-sampling_moments` (moments only, not confidence intervals)

In addition, the execution group has the attribute ``equiv_hf_evals``, which
records the equivalent number of high-fidelity evaluations.

*Usage Tips*

The ``multifidelity_sampling`` method can be used in combination with
either a hierarchical or non-hierarchical model specification for
either a model form sequence or a discretization level sequence.  For
a model form sequence, each model must provide a scalar
``solution_level_cost``.  For a discretization level sequence, it is
necessary to identify the variable string descriptor that controls the
resolution levels using ``solution_level_control`` as well as the
associated array of relative costs using ``solution_level_cost``.

The hierarchical two-model approach is a special case of the
non-hierarchical multi-model approach.  The latter gives identical
results to the former when restricted to one approximation model; as
such, the hierarchical two-model approach is deprecated.

Examples::
We provide an example of a multifidelity Monte Carlo study using a
non-hierarchical model specification employing multiple approximations.

The following method block:

.. code-block::

    method,
     model_pointer = 'NONHIER'
     multifidelity_sampling
       pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
       max_iterations = 10
       convergence_tolerance = .001

specifies MFMC in combination with the model identified by the
NONHIER pointer.

This NONHIER model specification provides a one-dimensional sequence,
here defined by a single truth model and a set of unordered approximation
models, each with a single (or default) discretization level:

.. code-block::

    model,
     id_model = 'NONHIER'
     surrogate non_hierarchical
       truth_model = 'HF'
       unordered_model_fidelities = 'LF1' 'LF2'
    
    model,
     id_model = 'LF1'
     interface_pointer = 'LF1_INT'
     simulation
       solution_level_cost = 0.01
    
    model,
     id_model = 'LF2'
     interface_pointer = 'LF2_INT'
     simulation
       solution_level_cost = 0.1
    
    model,
     id_model = 'HF'
     interface_pointer = 'HF_INT'
     simulation
       solution_level_cost = 1.
