Blurb::
Generic UQ method for constructing and interrogating a surrogate model.
Description::
As surrogate models by stochastic expansion migrate into the model specification,
this method provides a general-purpose UQ method to interrogate the surrogate for
generating statistics.

This method must identify the surrogate of interest through its ``model_pointer``,
distinguishing it from fully-integrated method specifications such as
:dakkw:`method-polynomial_chaos`, :dakkw:`method-stoch_collocation`, and
:dakkw:`method-function_train` that couple directly with a simulation model
(and form the PCE, SC, FT surrogate approximations implicitly prior to using
them for generating statistics).
