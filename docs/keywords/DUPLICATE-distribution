Blurb::
Selection of cumulative or complementary cumulative functions
Description::
The ``distribution`` keyword allows the user to select between a
cumulative distribution/belief/plausibility function and a
complementary cumulative distribution/belief/plausibility function.
This choice affects how probabilities and reliability indices are
reported.

*Default Behavior*

If the ``distribution`` keyword is present, it must be accompanied by
either ``cumulative`` or ``complementary``.  Otherwise, a cumulative
distribution will be used by default.

*Expected Outputs*

Output will be a set of model response-probability pairs determined
according to the choice of distribution. The choice of distribution
also defines the sign of the reliability or generalized reliability
indices.
