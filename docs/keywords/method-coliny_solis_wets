Simple greedy local search method
Description::
The Solis-Wets method is a simple greedy local search heuristic for
continuous parameter spaces. Solis-Wets generates trial points using a
multivariate normal distribution, and unsuccessful trial points are
reflected about the current point to find a descent direction.

.. note::
    See the page :ref:`topic-package_scolib` for important information
    regarding all SCOLIB methods.

``coliny_solis_wets`` is inherently serial, no concurrency is used.

These specifications have the same meaning as corresponding
specifications for :dakkw:`method-coliny_pattern_search`. Please see that
page for specification details.

In particular, ``coliny_solis_wets`` supports dynamic rescaling of the
step length, and dynamic rescaling of the constraint penalty. The only
new specification is ``contract_after_failure``, which specifies the
number of unsuccessful cycles which must occur with a specific delta
prior to contraction of the delta.

*Expected HDF5 Output*

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the
:dakkw:`environment-results_output-hdf5` keyword, this method
writes the following results to HDF5:


- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_params`
- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_obj_fncs` (when :dakkw:`responses-objective_functions`) are specified)
- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_constraints`
- :ref:`hdf5_results-calibration` (when :dakkw:`responses-calibration_terms` are specified)
