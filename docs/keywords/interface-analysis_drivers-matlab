Run Matlab through a direct interface - requires special Dakota build
Description::
Dakota supports a :ref:`library-linked interface to Matlab <advint:existingdirect>`, which

compiling Dakota from source.
 
The :dakkw:`interface-analysis_drivers` specifies a Matlab file which
implements the parameter to response mapping.
