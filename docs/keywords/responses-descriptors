Labels for the responses
Description::
A list of strings which identify the responses.  These are used in
console and tabular output.  Response descriptors are ordered by
primary response functions (objective, calibration, or response
functions), followed by inequality, then equality constraints, if
present.

*Default Behavior*

The default descriptor strings use a response type-dependent root
string plus a one-based numeric identifier:


- Objective functions: ``obj_fn_i``
- Calibration terms: ``least_sq_term_i``
- Nonlinear inequality constraints: ``nln_ineq_con_i``
- Nonlinear equality constraints: ``nln_eq_con_i``
- Response functions: ``response_fn_``

*Expected Output*
Dakota will label the various response functions in console and
tabular output.

*Usage Tips*
When specifying descriptors for scalar and/or field responses, include
as many descriptors as top-level scalar + field responses, e.g.,

.. code-block::

    responses
      descriptors 'scalar1' 'scalar2' 'scalar3' 'field1' 'field2'
      response_functions 5
        scalar_responses 3
        field_responses 2
          field_lengths 42 24

Dakota will append a numeric identifier for each field entry, for a
total of 42 field1_j and 24 field2_k in this example.
