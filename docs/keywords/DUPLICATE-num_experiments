Add context to data: number of different experiments
Description::
The number of different experiments.  Dakota will expand the total
number of residual terms based on the number of calibration terms and
the number of experiments.  For example, if the number of calibration terms
are five scalars, and there are three experiments, the total number of
residuals in the least squares formulation will be 15.
