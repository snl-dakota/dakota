Perform each function evaluation in a separate working directory
Description::
When performing concurrent evaluations, it is typically necessary to
cloister simulation input and output files in separate directories to
avoid conflicts.  When the ``work_directory`` feature is enabled,
Dakota will create a directory for each evaluation, with optional
tagging ( ``directory_tag``) and saving ( ``directory_save`` ), as with
files, and execute the analysis driver from that working directory.

The directory may be ``named`` with a string, or left anonymous to use
an automatically-generated directory in the system's temporary file
space, e.g., /tmp/dakota_work_c93vb71z/. The optional ``link_files``
and ``copy_files`` keywords specify files or directories which should
appear in each working directory.

When using work_directory, the :dakkw:`interface-analysis_drivers` may be
given by an absolute path, located in (or relative to) the startup
directory alongside the Dakota input file, in the list of template
files linked or copied, or on the $PATH (Path% on Windows).
