Perform a partial recursion of admissible DAGs

Description::

A partial recursion includes admissible directed acyclic graphs
(DAGs) up to a specified depth, where the depth specification is required.  Refer to
:dakkw:`method-approximate_control_variate-search_model_graphs-partial_recursion-depth_limit`
for additional details.

Partial recursions are useful when the number of DAGs to explore grows large
for a ``full_recursion``.
