Number of random starting points
Description::
The ``multi_start`` meta-iterator must specify a sub-iterator using
either a ``method_pointer`` or a ``method_name`` plus optional
``model_pointer``.  This iterator is responsible for completing a series
of iterative analyses from a set of different starting points.  These
starting points can be specified as follows: (1) using
``random_starts``, for which the specified number of starting points are
selected randomly within the variable bounds, (2) using
``starting_points``, in which the starting values are provided in a list,
or (3) using both ``random_starts`` and ``starting_points``, for which
the combined set of points will be used.
