Blurb::
User-customizable portion of exported/imported surrogate model
filenames
Description::
Dakota surrogate model files are exported and imported using one file
per response, per requested format. The files are named using the
pattern ``{prefix}``.{response_descriptor}.{extension}. This
``filename_prefix`` keyword is used to supply the prefix portion of the
pattern.

The ``response_descriptor`` portion of the pattern is filled in using
the response :dakkw:`responses-descriptors` provided by the user (or, if
none are specified, descriptors automatically generated by
Dakota). Extension is a three or four letter string that depends on
the format.
Topics::
surrogate_models
Examples::
This input snippet directs Dakota to write one algebraic format file
and one binary archive file for each response. The names of the files
will follow the patterns ``my_surrogate``.{response_descriptor}.alg
(for the algebraic files) and
``my_surrogate``.{response_descriptor}.bsps (for the binary files).
