Interface block pointer for the single model type
Description::
In the ``single`` model case, a single interface is used to map the
variables into responses.  The optional ``interface_pointer``
specification identifies this interface by cross-referencing with the
``id_interface`` string input from a particular interface keyword
specification.

See :ref:`topic-block_pointer` for details about pointers.

When an interface pointer is not specified, the model will use the last
interface block parsed from the input file.
