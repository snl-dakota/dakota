Specify a dedicated scheduler partition for concurrent analysis executions
Description::
This option overrides the Dakota parallel automatic configuration, forcing
the use of a dedicated scheduler partition. In this partition, one processor
(the "dedicated scheduler") dynamically schedules work on the analysis
servers. This reduces the number of processors available to create servers
by 1.
