Name the method block; helpful when there are multiple
Description::
The method identifier string is supplied with ``id_method`` and is used
to provide a unique identifier string for use with environment or
meta-iterator specifications (refer to :dakkw:`environment`). It is
appropriate to omit a method identifier string if only one method is
included in the input file, since the single method to use is
unambiguous in this case.
