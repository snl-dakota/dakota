Blurb::
Throttle multilevel BLUE to only solve for allocations using the groups with the best conditioning in their group covariances

Description::
The number of groups in ML BLUE is initially defined using all
combinations of the model indices, and group covariances are computed
for every group.  This throttle then retains a number of groups specified
by the provided count, where the retained groups have the highest inverse
condition number ("rcond") for their group covariances.  This is closely
related to :dakkw:`method-multilevel_blue-group_throttle-rcond_tolerance`
except that the worst-case group conditioning is not controlled directly.

	  group_throttle best_conditioned = 100
