Assess convergence in adaptive UQ methods using statistical metrics that are relative to a benchmark

Description::
When adaptively refining a UQ method (e.g., allocating sample allocations for
metric estimation or surrogate training), the ``relative`` option
indicates that the metric is assessed relative to a current reference
value (e.g. estimator variance after a pilot sample), such that the
convergence tolerance controls the relative accuracy.
