Set the initial population size in JEGA methods
Description::
The number of designs in the initial population is specified by the
``population_size``.  Note that the ``population_size`` only sets the size
of the initial population.  The population size may vary in the JEGA
methods according to the type of operators chosen for a particular
optimization run.

Also note that some initializers may not strictly respect the initial
population size.  See the SOGA
:dakkw:`method-soga-initialization_type-flat_file` or MOGA
:dakkw:`method-moga-initialization_type-flat_file` initializer for an example.
