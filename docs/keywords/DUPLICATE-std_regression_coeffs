Output Standardized Regression Coefficients and R^2 for samples

Description::
Obtain standardized regression coefficients and coefficient of
determination, R^2 from a linear regression model constructed from
input-output samples for each response.  Requires the new surrogates module.


*Default Behavior*

Off by default.

*Expected Output*

When ``std_regression_coeffs`` is specified, a linear regression model
for each response is constructed and the standardized coefficients for 
each variable are reported together with the coefficient of determination 
representing the goodness of fit of each linear regression model.  
Standardization corresponds to subtracting the mean and dividing the result 
by the standard deviation of each variable.  Whereas regular regression 
coefficients represent how much the mean of the response changes with a 
unit increase in each variable with other variables held fixed, standardized 
regression coefficients represent how the standard deviation of the response 
changes for a standard deviation change in each variable with all other variables
fixed and are insensitive to variable scaling.
