Multilevel-Multifidelity sampling methods for UQ
Description::
An adaptive sampling method that utilizes both multilevel and
multifidelity relationships within a hierarchical surrogate model in
order to improve efficiency through variance reduction.

In the case of a multilevel relationship, multilevel Monte Carlo
methods are used to compute an optimal sample allocation per level,
and in the case of a multifidelity relationship, control variate Monte
Carlo methods are used to compute an optimal sample allocation per
fidelity.  These two approaches can also be combined, resulting in the
multilevel-multifidelity sampling approach below.

*Multilevel Control Variate Monte Carlo*

If both multilevel and multifidelity structure are included within a
hierarchical model specification, then an inner control variate can be
applied across two model fidelities for each level within an outer
multilevel approach.

On each level, a control variate is active for the discrepancy :math:`Y_{\ell}` 
based on

.. math::  Y_{\ell}^\star = Y_{\ell} + \alpha_\ell \left( \hat{Y}^{\mathrm{LF}}_\ell - \mathbb{E}\left[ Y^{\mathrm{LF}}_\ell \right] \right), 

where :math:`Y^{\mathrm{LF}}_\ell = \gamma_\ell Q^{\mathrm{LF}}_\ell - Q^{\mathrm{HF}}_\ell` .

The optimal parameter :math:`\gamma_\ell`  is computed from the correlation properties
between model forms and discretization levels (see the theory manual for further details)
and the optimal allocation :math:`N_\ell`  (per level) is finally obtained from it.

*Default Behavior*

The ``multilevel_multifidelity_sampling`` method employs Monte Carlo
sample sets be default, but this default can be overridden to use Latin
hypercube sample sets using ``sample_type`` ``lhs``.

*Expected Output*

The ``multilevel_multifidelity_sampling`` method reports estimates of
the first four moments and a summary of the evaluations performed for
each model fidelity and discretization level.  The method does not
support any level mappings (response, probability, reliability,
generalized reliability) at this time.

*Expected HDF5 Output*

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the
:ref:`environment-results_output-hdf5<environment-results_output-hdf5>` keyword, this method
writes the following results to HDF5:


- :ref:`hdf5_results-sampling_moments` (moments only, not confidence intervals)

In addition, the execution group has the attribute ``equiv_hf_evals``, which
records the equivalent number of high-fidelity evaluations.

*Usage Tips*

The ``multilevel_multifidelity_sampling`` method must be used in
combination with a hierarchical model specification.  The highest and
lowest fidelity model must provide multiple discretization levels, for
which it is necessary to identify the variable string descriptor that
controls the resolution levels using ``solution_level_control`` as well
as the associated array of relative costs using
``solution_level_cost``.

Examples::
The following method block

.. code-block::

    method,
     model_pointer = 'HIERARCH'
     multilevel_multifidelity_sampling
       pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237  #s0,#s1,#s2,#s3,#p0,#p1
       convergence_tolerance = .01   #s0,#s2,#s3,#p0,#p1


specifies a multilevel-multifidelity Monte Carlo study in combination
with the model identified by the HIERARCH pointer.  This model
specification provides a two-dimensional hierarchy, comprised of two
model forms each with four discretization levels:


.. code-block::

    model,
     id_model = 'HIERARCH'
     surrogate hierarchical
       ordered_model_fidelities = 'LF' 'HF'
    
    model,
     id_model = 'LF'
     simulation
       solution_level_control = 'N_x'
       solution_level_cost = 375. 10125. 81000. 648000.
    
    model,
     id_model = 'HF'
     simulation
       solution_level_control = 'N_x'
       solution_level_cost = 5.67e+5 4.536e+6 2.1e+7 1.68e+8
