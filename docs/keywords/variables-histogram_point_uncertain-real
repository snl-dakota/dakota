Blurb::
Real valued point histogram variable
Description::
This probability mass function is real-valued; the abscissa values
must all be integers.  The ``n`` abscissa values are paired with ``n``
``counts`` which indicate the relative frequency (mass) of each real
relative to the other specified reals.

.. code-block::

    histogram_point_uncertain
      real = 2
      pairs_per_variable = 2               3
      abscissas          = 3.1415 4.5389   100 200.112345 300
      counts             = 1      1        1   2          1


There are two variables, the first one has two possible real values
which are equally probable.  The second one has three possible real
value options, and 200.112345 is twice as probable as either 100 or
300.
