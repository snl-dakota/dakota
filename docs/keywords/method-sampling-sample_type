Selection of sampling strategy
Description::
The ``sample_type`` keyword allows the user to select between three types
of sampling: Monte Carlo (pure random), Latin hypercube
(stratified), and low-discrepancy (quasi-Monte Carlo) sampling.

The incremental keywords are deprecated; instead use ``samples``
together with ``refinement_samples``.

*Default Behavior*

If the ``sample_type`` keyword is present, it must be accompanied by
``lhs``, ``random`` or ``low_discrepancy``.  In most contexts, ``lhs`` is the 
default (exception: multilevel_sampling uses Monte Carlo by default).
