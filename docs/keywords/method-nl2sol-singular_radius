Singular radius
Description::
``singular_radius`` works in conjunction with :dakkw:`method-nl2sol-singular_conv_tol`
to test for underdetermined least-squares problems (stop when the relative
reduction yet possible in the sum of squares appears less than
``singular_conv_tol`` for steps of scaled length at most
:dakkw:`method-nl2sol-singular_radius`).

The internal default results in the internal use of steps of length 1. The
default is selected with a value of -1.
