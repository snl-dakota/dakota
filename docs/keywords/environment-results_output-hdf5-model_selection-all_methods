Write evaluation data to HDF5 for all models that belong directly to methods
Description::
When this option is selection, evaluation data for all models that belong
directly to methods will be written to HDF5. Models that belong to other
models (e.g. wrapped models in a recast relationship) are not stored.

By default, when HDF5 output is enabled, Dakota writes evaluation
data only for the model that belongs to the top-level method. This
keyword group is used to override the default.

HDF5 output is an experimental feature, and the contents and organization of
the output file is subject to change. The current organization and a
brief explanation of HDF5 is provided in the :ref:`hdf5_output<hdf5_output>` section
of this manual.

Examples::
For the example input in the parent keyword, the following model groups would be
written:


- ``/models/recast/RECAST_surr_RECAST_1/``
- ``/models/simulation/truth_m/``

The recast model, in this case, is automatically generated by Dakota to handle summing the
pair of objective functions. It is the model that belongs directly to the method 'opt'. See
:ref:`hdf5_evaluations-hdf5_eval_sources<hdf5_evaluations-hdf5_eval_sources>` for further explanation.

The following links would be added to methods and models ``sources`` groups:


- ``/methods/opt/sources/RECAST_surr_RECAST_1`` :math:`\rightarrow`  ``/models/recast/RECAST_surr_RECAST_1/``
- ``/methods/training/sources/truth_m`` :math:`\rightarrow`  ``/models/simulation/truth_m/``

Depending on :dakkw:`environment-results_output-hdf5-interface_selection`, the following links may also
be added to model ``sources`` groups:


- ``/models/simulation/truth_m/sources/truth`` :math:`\rightarrow`  ``/interfaces/truth/truth_m/``
