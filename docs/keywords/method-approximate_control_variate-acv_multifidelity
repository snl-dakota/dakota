Approximate control variate (ACV) algorithm that employs a nested pyramid sample pattern, similar to MFMC

Description::
This ACV variant uses sample set definitions that are similar to
multifidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC), in that sample sets are nested
with each new level adding an increment on top of the previous
(the sample layering is akin to a pyramid).

The key difference between MFMC and ACV-MF is their underlying
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that define the control variate
pairings: MFMC employs a "hierarchical" DAG where each approximation
node points to the next approximation of higher fidelity, ending with
the truth model, and ACV-MF employs a "peer" DAG where all
approximation nodes point to the root node.  In all cases, the root
node identifies the reference "truth" model.  Due to its recursive
nature, the hierarchical DAG is limited by the maximum variance
reduction that is achievable from a perfect estimation of the
most correlated control mean ("OCV-1"), where the peer case does
not have this limitation.

Refer to :cite:p:`GORODETSKY2020109257` for the original ACV
formulation.  Refer to :cite:p:`Bomarito2022` for understanding ACV
generalizations for the different control variate pairings that are
possible when codified into a more comprehensive set of potential
DAGs.  Both papers provide sample set diagrams that are instructive
for understanding the different formulations, although the notation
differs slightly (we adopt the former reference's notation herein).
