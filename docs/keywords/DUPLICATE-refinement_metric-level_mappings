Utilize the level mappings metric for guiding adaptive refinement during UQ.

Description::
The level mappings option allows the user to override the default
refinement control, in particular activating the L2 norm of the change
in any level mappings.  If no level mappings are present, a warning
will be output and the metric will fall back to the norm of the change
in the response covariance.
