Blurb::
Requires correct function value labels in results file
Description::
The ``labeled`` keyword directs Dakota to enforce a stricter results file
format and enables more detailed error reporting.

When the ``labeled`` keyword is used, function values in results
files must be accompanied by their corresponding descriptors. If the
user did not supply response :dakkw:`responses-descriptors` in her Dakota
input file, then Dakota auto-generated descriptors are expected.

Distinct error messages are emitted for function values that are out-of-order,
repeated, or missing. Labels that appear without a function value and unexpected data
are also reported as errors. Dakota attempts to report all errors in a results
file, not just the first it encounters. After reporting results file errors, Dakota
aborts.

Labels for analytic gradients and Hessians currently are not supported.

Although the ``labeled`` keyword is optional, its use is recommended to help catch
and identify problems with results files. The User's Manual contains further information
about the results file format.

*Default Behavior*
<p> By default, Dakota does not require labels for function values, and
ignores them if they are present.</p>
