Blurb::
Perform a full recursion of all admissible DAGs for a given model ensemble

Description::
A full recursion includes admissible directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) up to maximum
depth and is equivalent to a ``partial_recursion`` with a ``depth_limit`` equal to
the number of approximation models.

Topics::

Examples::

.. code-block::

    method,
    	model_pointer = 'ENSEMBLE'
    	approximate_control_variate acv_mf
    	  pilot_samples = 25 seed = 8674132
    	  search_model_graphs full_recursion
    	  max_function_evaluations = 500

Theory::
