Blurb::
Parameter for the Multi-level MCMC algorithm in MUQ

Description::
How many samples to take at each level before using one as proposal sample for the next level.
Note that this should be a vector with as many entries as desired levels set via the ``solution_level_control``.


*Default Behavior*

No default behavior, this MUST be specified.

Topics::
bayesian_calibration, solution_level_control
