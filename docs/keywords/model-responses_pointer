Specify which reponses block will be used by this model block
Description::
The ``responses_pointer`` is used to specify which responses block will be used
by the model, by cross-referencing with :dakkw:`responses-id_responses` keyword in
the :dakkw:`responses` block.

See :ref:`topic-block_pointer` for details about pointers.

*Default Behavior*

When a responses pointer is not specified, the model will use the last
responses block parsed from the input file.
