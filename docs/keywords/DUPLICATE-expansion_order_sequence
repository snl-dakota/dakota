Sequence of expansion orders used in a multi-stage expansion
Description::
Each level entry of the ``expansion_order_sequence`` applies to one
expansion within a multi-stage expansion.  Current multi-stage
expansions that support expansion order sequences include multilevel
or multifidelity polynomial chaos.

If adaptive refinement is active, then this sequence specifies the
starting point for each level within either an individual or
integrated refinement approach.

A corresponding scalar specification is documented at, e.g.,
:dakkw:`method-polynomial_chaos-expansion_order`
