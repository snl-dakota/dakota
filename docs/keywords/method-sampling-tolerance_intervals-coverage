Blurb::

The coverage to be used for the calculation of the lower and upper ends
of the interval covering the user supplied samples.

Description::

The coverage must be a value between 0 and 1.
Once the mean and standard deviation 's_equiv' of the equivalent normal
distribution are computed (based on the "confidence_level" input parameter),
Dakota uses this "coverage" input parameter to know how much it has to
multiply 's_equiv' in order to get the lower and upper ends of the interval
covering the user supplied samples.

*Default Behavior*

A value of 0.95 (95%) is the default value for this parameter.
