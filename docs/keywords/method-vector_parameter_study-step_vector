Size of step for each variable
Description::
The ``step_vector`` keyword specifies how much each variable will be
incremented in a single step.

``step_vector`` works in conjunction with ``num_steps``, which determines
the number of steps taken during the ``vector_parameter_study``. If instead
of ``step_vector``, ``final_point`` is specified with ``num_steps``, Dakota will
infer the step sizes.

Entries in the ``step_vector`` are the actual amounts by which continuous and range
variables are incremented. For set variables, ``step_vector`` entries
are interpreted as indexes into the underlying set.

*Default Behavior*

The user is required to specify either ``final_point`` or ``step_vector``.
There is no default definition for the vector.

        num_steps = 3
        # Add 2.0 to x1 and increment s1 by 1 element in each step
        step_vector =    2.0      1
