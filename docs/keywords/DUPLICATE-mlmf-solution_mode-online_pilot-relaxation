For an online pilot mode, apply under-relaxation to the shared sample increments

Description::
Multilevel / multifidelity sampling methods are adaptive UQ methods
that utilize a pilot sample to estimate an initial set of correlations
or variances, and then augment the pilot with additional sample
increments to optimally allocate resources.  In the iterated
``online_pilot`` solution mode, the initial pilot sample is updated with
additional shared samples in the direction of the optimal solution to
the resource allocation problem.  When the initial correlation /
covariance approximations are inaccurate, this update can be overly
aggressive, such that it becomes advisable to only accept a portion of
this suggested increment through use of an under-relaxation factor.

Three options are provided for defining a sequence of under-relaxation
factors: ``factor_sequence``, ``fixed_factor``, and ``recursive_factor``.

**Default Behavior**

Relaxation is an optional specification, and no relaxation (accept the
full magnitude of suggested sample increments) is the default.
