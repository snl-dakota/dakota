A subordinate local method provides periodic refinements to a top-level global method
Description::
In the ``embedded`` approach, a tightly-coupled hybrid is employed in
which a subordinate local method provides periodic refinements to a
top-level global method.

Global and local method strings supplied with the
``global_method_pointer`` and ``local_method_pointer`` specifications
identify the two methods to be used. Alternatively, Dakota method names
(e.g. ' :dakkw:`method-soga`') can be supplied using the ``global_method_name`` and
``local_method_name`` keywords, which each have optional model pointer
specifications. The ``local_search_probability`` setting is an optional
specification for supplying the probability (between 0.0 and 1.0) of employing
local search to improve estimates within the global search.
