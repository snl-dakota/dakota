Multilevel sampling methods for UQ
Description::
An adaptive sampling method that utilizes multilevel
relationships within a hierarchical surrogate model in order to
improve efficiency through variance reduction.

In the case of a multilevel relationship, multilevel Monte Carlo
methods are used to compute an optimal sample allocation per level.

*Multilevel Monte Carlo*

The Monte Carlo estimator for the mean is defined as

.. math::  \mathbb{E}[Q] \equiv \hat{Q}^{MC} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N Q^{(i)} 

In a multilevel method with :math:`L`  levels, we replace this estimator
with a telescoping sum:

.. math::  \mathbb{E}[Q] \equiv \hat{Q}^{ML}
   = \sum_{l=0}^L \frac{1}{N_l} \sum_{i=1}^{N_l} (Q_l^{(i)} - Q_{l-1}^{(i)})
   \equiv \sum_{l=0}^L \hat{Y}^{MC}_l 

This decomposition forms discrepancies for each level greater than 0,
seeking reduction in the variance of the discrepancy :math:`Y`  relative
to the variance of the original response :math:`Q` .  The number of samples
allocated for each level ( :math:`N_l` ) is based on a total cost minimization
procedure that incorporates the relative cost and observed variance for each
of the :math:`Y_\ell` .

*Default Behavior*

The ``multilevel_sampling`` method employs Monte Carlo sample sets by
default, but this default can be overridden to use Latin hypercube
sample sets using ``sample_type`` ``lhs``.

*Expected Output*

The ``multilevel_sampling`` method reports estimates of the first four
moments and a summary of the evaluations performed for each model
fidelity and discretization level.  The method does not support any
level mappings (response, probability, reliability, generalized
reliability) at this time.

*Expected HDF5 Output*

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the
:dakkw:`environment-results_output-hdf5` keyword, this method
writes the following results to HDF5:


- :ref:`hdf5_results-sampling_moments` (moments only, not confidence intervals)

In addition, the execution group has the attribute ``equiv_hf_evals``, which
records the equivalent number of high-fidelity evaluations.

*Usage Tips*

The multilevel sampling method must be used in combination with a
hierarchical model specification, and supports either a sequence of
model forms or a sequence of discretization levels.  For the former,
each model form must provide a scalar ``solution_level_cost`` and for the
latter, it is necessary to identify the variable string descriptor that
controls the resolution levels using ``solution_level_control`` as well
as the associated array of relative costs using ``solution_level_cost``.

Examples::
The following method block

.. code-block::

    method,
     model_pointer = 'HIERARCH'
     multilevel_sampling
       pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
       max_iterations = 10
       convergence_tolerance = .001


specifies a multilevel Monte Carlo study in combination with the model
identified by the HIERARCH pointer.  This model specification provides
a one-dimensional hierarchy, typically defined by a single model
fidelity with multiple discretization levels, but may also be provided
as multiple ordered model fidelities, each with a single (or default)
discretization level.  An example of the former (single model fidelity
with multiple discretization levels) follows:

.. code-block::

    model,
     id_model = 'HIERARCH'
     surrogate hierarchical
       ordered_model_fidelities = 'SIM1'
       correction additive zeroth_order
    
    model,
     id_model = 'SIM1'
     simulation
       solution_level_control = 'N_x'
       solution_level_cost = 630. 1260. 2100. 4200.
