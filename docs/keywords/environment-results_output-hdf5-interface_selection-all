Write evaluation data for all interfaces to HDF5
Description::
When this option is selected, evaluation data for all interfaces, including
both simulations and approximations, will be written to HDF5.

HDF5 output is an experimental feature, and the contents and organization of
the output file is subject to change. The current organization and a
brief explanation of HDF5 is provided in the :ref:`hdf5_output<hdf5_output>` section
of this manual.
Topics::
dakota_output
Examples::
For the example input in the parent keyword, the following interface groups would be
written:


- ``/interfaces/truth/truth_m/``
- ``/interfaces/APPROX_INTERFACE_1/surr/``

Depending on the :dakkw:`environment-results_output-hdf5-model_selection`, the following links
may be added to model ``sources`` groups.


- ``/models/simulation/truth_m/sources/truth`` :math:`\rightarrow`  ``/interfaces/truth/truth_m/``
- ``/models/surrogate/surr/sources/APPROX_INTERFACE_1`` :math:`\rightarrow`  ``/interfaces/APPROX_INTERFACE_1/surr/``
