Expect results files in JSON format

Description::

When this keyword is used, Dakota expects results files written
by an analysis driver or output filter to be in JSON
format, which is explained :ref:`here <responses:results:json>`.
Some strengths of the JSON format are that it is a widely
used format for data interchange,  and the metadata it includes reduce
the potential for driver bugs.
