Run Python through a Pybind11-based direct interface - requires a special Dakota build
Description::
Dakota supports :ref:`a library-linked interface to Python <advint:existingdirect>`, which
may not be available in pre-built downloads of Dakota and must be explicitly enabled when
compiling Dakota from source.

The :dakkw:`interface-analysis_drivers` keyword specifies a
Python module:function which implements the parameter to
response mapping.  List data structures are the default,
but NumPy is also supported, if enabled in the build.

Batch evaluations ( :dakkw:`interface-batch`) are supported through a
list of dictionaries.
