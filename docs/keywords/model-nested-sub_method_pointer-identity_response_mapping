Identity mapping of sub-method results to top-level responses
Description::
Specifies that the list of sub-method results (statistics, best
parameters, etc.) should map one-to-one to the list of top-level
nested model responses.

*Usage Tips*

To use an identity mapping, the number of top-level nested model
responses (primary + secondary responses) must equal the number of
sub-method results. If receiving an error about this, set ``output``
``verbose`` and re-run the Dakota study to see a list of sub-method
results responses.

The identity map may not be used in conjunction with
:dakkw:`model-nested-optional_interface_pointer`, nor with an explicit
``primary_response_mapping`` or ``secondary_response_mapping``.
