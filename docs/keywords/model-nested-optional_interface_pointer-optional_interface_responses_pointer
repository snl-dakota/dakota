Pointer to responses block that defines non-nested responses
Description::
``optional_interface_responses_pointer`` points to the reponses block (specifically,
its :dakkw:`responses-id_responses` label) that defines the non-nested response to return
to the nested model. The ``primary_response_mapping`` keywords control how these
non-nested respones are combined with responses from the nested sub-iterator. See the
entry for ``optional_interface_pointer`` for a full description. If
``optional_interface_responses_pointer`` is not provided, the top-level.
responses specification is reused.
