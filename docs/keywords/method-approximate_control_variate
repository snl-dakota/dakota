Approximate control variate (ACV) sampling methods for UQ

Description::
An adaptive sampling method that utilizes multifidelity
relationships in order to improve efficiency through variance reduction.
It employs an ensemble model to manage an unordered set of
lower-fidelity approximations to a single truth model.

Compared to multifidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC), ACV is not a recursive
emulator based on hierarchical control variate pairings.  Rather, the
truth model's variance is targeted using each control variate pairing.
These pairings are codified with a directed acyclic graph (DAG), such
that ACV defines a "peer" DAG where all approximation nodes point to the
root node and the root node identifies the reference "truth" model.
MFMC, on the other hand, employs a "hierarchical" DAG, where each
approximation node points to the next approximation of higher
fidelity, ending with the truth model at the root node.

While the ensemble of control variates appears identical to MFMC:


.. math::  \hat{Q}_{HF}^{CV} = \hat{Q}_{HF}^{MC} - \sum_{i=1}^M \beta_i (\hat{Q}_{LF_i}^{MC} - \mathbb{E}[Q_{LF_i}]) 

the sample patterns used for the constituent estimators differ as
depicted in :cite:p:`GORODETSKY2020109257`, Figure 2, with the
:math:`z^1` and :math:`z^2` definitions reflective of the control
variate pairings.

In the generalized ACV case (:cite:p:`Bomarito2022`) available from
the :dakkw:`method-approximate_control_variate-search_model_graphs`
specification, three different ACV sampling schemes are supported:
ACV-MF (multifidelity), ACV-IS (independent sampling), and ACV-RD
(recursive difference), where each scheme supports an enumerative
search over admissible DAGs and model subset selections.  Each
of these three schemes is also supported in non-generalized form
for specific DAG definitions, as follows:

* ACV-MF: peer DAG in :dakkw:`method-approximate_control_variate` and hierarchical DAG in :dakkw:`method-multifidelity_sampling`

* ACV-IS: peer DAG in :dakkw:`method-approximate_control_variate`.

* ACV-RD: hierarchical DAG in :dakkw:`method-multilevel_sampling` using the :dakkw:`weighted` option.

Finally, the ACV-KL variant (:cite:p:`GORODETSKY2020109257`) is not
another sampling scheme, but rather a parametrically defined estimator
that enumerates a relatively small subset of admissible DAGs. It is
available under the
:dakkw:`method-approximate_control_variate-search_model_graphs-kl_recursion`
option, using the approaches described in :cite:p:`Bomarito2022`.


*Default Behavior*

The ``approximate_control_variate`` method employs a number of important
default settings:

* The DAG defining control variate pairings defaults to a "peer" DAG where all approximation nodes point to the root node and the root node identifies the reference "truth" model.  This means that every approximation participates in a sample set that is shared with the truth model (the root allocation), and each approximation (each of the nodes connecting to the root) then has its own augmentation to this shared set.  For ACV-IS and ACV-RD, these augmentations are independent.  To explore other admissible DAGs, ``search_model_graphs`` can be used.

* The default solver is ``global_local``, starting with the DIRECT global solver and proceeding to available local solvers (SQP and NIP) in competition.  For larger model ensembles, a purely local approach is more scalable.

* Solution mode will be ``online_pilot``, an approach which iterates toward a set of shared samples whose size is consistent with the optimal allocation.

* Monte Carlo sample sets are used by default and are most consistent with the underlying theory, but this default can be overridden to use Latin hypercube sample sets using ``sample_type`` ``lhs``.  Allocations remain governed by Monte Carlo variance for all cases.


*Expected Output*

The ``approximate_control_variate`` method reports estimates of the
first four moments and a summary of the evaluations performed for each
model fidelity and discretization level.  The method does not support
any level mappings (response, probability, reliability, generalized
reliability) at this time.

*Expected HDF5 Output*

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the
:dakkw:`environment-results_output-hdf5` keyword, this method
writes the following results to HDF5:


- :ref:`hdf5_results-sampling_moments` (moments only, not confidence intervals)


In addition, the execution group has the attribute ``equiv_hf_evals``, which
records the equivalent number of high-fidelity evaluations.


*Usage Tips*

The ``approximate_control_variate`` method must be used in combination
with an ensemble model specification that enumerates a truth model and
a set of model approximations using either a model form sequence, a
discretization level sequence, or a combination of model forms and
discretization levels.  For each model form and discretization, each
instance must either provide a ``solution_level_cost`` or return
metadata for estimating cost.  For a sequence of discretization
levels, ``solution_level_control`` must identify the variable string
descriptor that controls the resolution levels and the associated
array of relative costs must be provided using
``solution_level_cost``.  An alternative to prescribing the cost
profile is estimating it on the fly using cost metadata that is
returned from the different simulation instances.

Examples::
The following method block:

.. code-block::

    method,
     model_pointer = 'NONHIER'
     approximate_control_variate
       acv_mf nip
       pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
       max_iterations = 10
       convergence_tolerance = .001

specifies ACV-MF using the nonlinear interior point (NIP) solver in
combination with the model identified by the NONHIER pointer.

This NONHIER model specification provides a one-dimensional sequence,
here defined by a single truth model and a set of unordered approximation
models, each with a single (or default) discretization level:

.. code-block::

    model,
     id_model = 'NONHIER'
     surrogate ensemble
       truth_model = 'HF'
       unordered_model_fidelities = 'LF1' 'LF2'
    
    model,
     id_model = 'LF1'
     interface_pointer = 'LF1_INT'
     simulation
       solution_level_cost = 1
    
    model,
     id_model = 'LF2'
     interface_pointer = 'LF2_INT'
     simulation
       solution_level_cost = 16
    
    model,
     id_model = 'HF'
     interface_pointer = 'HF_INT'
     simulation
       solution_level_cost = 256.
