Blurb::
Metric used for guiding adaptive refinement during UQ.

Description::
The refinement metric for each (greedy) refinement candidate defaults
to the change induced by the candidate across the set of level
mappings (L2 norm in the results for response levels, probability
levels, reliability levels, and generalized reliability levels)
whenever level mappings are specified.  This supports goal orientation
during the refinement process.  When no level mappings are specified,
the default metric is the norm of the change in the response
covariance matrix for the QoI targets.

This specification option allows the user to override the default, in
particular activating the response covariance option despite the
presence of level mappings (see example below).
