Replace MFMC analytic allocation with a numerical solution
Description::
Unconditionally employ a numerical solve for allocation of
samples per model instance within multifidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC).
The analytic allocation is replaced with numerical solution using either
``sqp`` or ``nip`` solvers.

*Usage Tips*
An unconditional override can be appropriate in the case where you select
a pilot sample that may be larger than the anticipated optimal sample
profile results (pilot over-estimation).  In this context, the numerical
optimization has greater freedom to work around the incurred pilot cost
and find a solution that optimally incorporates the pilot.
