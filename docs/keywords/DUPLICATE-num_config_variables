Add context to data: number of configuration variables.
Description::
If there are multiple experiments, there can be different
configuration variables (e.g. experimental settings, boundary
conditions, etc.) per experiment.  See
:dakkw:`responses-calibration_terms-calibration_data` or
:dakkw:`responses-calibration_terms-calibration_data_file`.

During calibration, configuration variables are state variables which
will be passed to the simulation, and are not treated as calibration
parameters.
