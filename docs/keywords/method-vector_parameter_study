Samples variables along a user-defined vector
Description::
Dakota's vector parameter study computes response data sets at
selected intervals along a vector in parameter space. It is often used
for single-coordinate parameter studies (to study the effect of a
single variable on a response set), but it can be used more generally
for multiple coordinate vector studies (to investigate the response
variations along some n-dimensional vector such as an optimizer search
direction).

*Default Behavior*

By default, the vector parameter study operates over all
types of variables.

*Expected Outputs*

A vector parameter study produces a set of responses for
each parameter set that is generated.

*Expected HDF5 Output*

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the
:ref:`environment-results_output-hdf5<environment-results_output-hdf5>` keyword, this method
writes the following results to HDF5:


- :ref:`hdf5_results-pstudies`

*Usage Tips*

*Group 1* is used to define the vector along which the parameters are
varied. Both cases also rely on the variables specification of an
initial value, through:

- the :ref:`variables-continuous_design-initial_point<variables-continuous_design-initial_point>` keyword
- the :ref:`variables-continuous_state-initial_state<variables-continuous_state-initial_state>` keyword
- relying on the default initial value, based on the rest of the     variables specification

From the initial value, the vector can be defined using one of the
two keyword choices.

Once the vector is defined, the samples are then fully specifed
by :ref:`method-vector_parameter_study-num_steps<method-vector_parameter_study-num_steps>`.
