Method used to build the rotation matrix
Description::
The rotation matrix for the Adapted Basis method is built starting from a matrix which includes the linear PCE coefficients. The entries of the first row are the linear PCE coefficients. For all the other rows, each row has only one nonzero entry. Depending on the way used to construct all the rows, from the second to last one, there are two implemented methods, :dakkw:`model-adapted_basis-truth_model_pointer-rotation_method-unranked` and :dakkw:`model-adapted_basis-truth_model_pointer-rotation_method-ranked`. A followed Gram_schmidt process is applied on the resulting matrix to make it an isometry.

*Default Behavior*

The default is to use the
:dakkw:`model-adapted_basis-truth_model_pointer-rotation_method-ranked`.

*Usage Tips*
Topics::

Examples::
The following method block


.. code-block::

    model
      id_model = 'SUBSPACE'
      adapted_basis
        truth_model_pointer = 'FULLSPACE'
        sparse_grid_level = 1
        rotation_method = unranked


changes the default method to the :dakkw:`model-adapted_basis-truth_model_pointer-rotation_method-unranked` method.
