Write evaluation data to HDF5 for all models
Description::
When this option is selected, evaluation for all models will
be written to HDF5.

HDF5 output is an experimental feature, and the contents and organization of
the output file is subject to change. The current organization and a
brief explanation of HDF5 is provided in the :ref:`hdf5_output<hdf5_output>` section
of this manual.
Topics::
dakota_output
Examples::
For the example input in the parent keyword, the following model groups would be
written:


- ``/models/recast/RECAST_surr_RECAST_1/``
- ``/models/simulation/truth_m/``
- ``/models/surrogate/surr/``

The recast model, in this case, is automatically generated by Dakota to handle summing the
pair of objective functions. See :ref:`hdf5_evaluations-hdf5_eval_sources<hdf5_evaluations-hdf5_eval_sources>` for further explanation.

The following links would be added to methods and models ``sources`` groups:

- ``/methods/opt/sources/RECAST_surr_RECAST_1`` :math:`\rightarrow`  ``/models/recast/RECAST_surr_RECAST_1/``
- ``/methods/training/sources/truth_m`` :math:`\rightarrow`  ``/models/simulation/truth_m/``
- ``/models/recast/RECAST_surr_RECAST_1/sources/surr`` :math:`\rightarrow`  ``/models/surrogate/surr/``

Depending on :dakkw:`environment-results_output-hdf5-interface_selection`, the following links may also
be added to model ``sources`` groups:


- ``/models/surrogate/surr/sources/APPROX_INTERFACE_1`` :math:`\rightarrow`  ``/interfaces/APPROX_INTERFACE_1/surr/``
- ``/models/simulation/truth_m/sources/truth`` :math:`\rightarrow`  ``/interfaces/truth/truth_m/``
