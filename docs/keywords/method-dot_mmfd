DOT modified method of feasible directions
Description::
DOT library :cite:p:`Van95` implementation of the modified method of
feasible directions for constrained optimizaiton.

See :ref:`topic-package_dot` for information common to all ``DOT`` methods.

*DOT requires a separate software license and therefore may not
be available in all versions of Dakota.  CONMIN or OPT++ methods may
be suitable alternatives.*

*Expected HDF5 Output*

If Dakota was built with HDF5 support and run with the
:dakkw:`environment-results_output-hdf5` keyword, this method
writes the following results to HDF5:


- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_params`
- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_obj_fncs` (when :dakkw:`responses-objective_functions`) are specified)
- :ref:`hdf5_results-best_constraints`
- :ref:`hdf5_results-calibration` (when :dakkw:`responses-calibration_terms` are specified)
