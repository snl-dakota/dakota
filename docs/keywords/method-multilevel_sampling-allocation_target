Blurb::
Allocation statistics/target for the MLMC sample allocation.
Description::
Computes the variance of the estimator for a given statistics/target and fits sample allocation by solving the corresponding optimization problem. The ``allocation_target`` specification supports options of ``mean`` (default), ``variance`` an analytic approximation is available. Additionally, a numerical optimization can be used in that case, see ``variance`` option :dakkw:`method-multilevel_sampling-allocation_target-variance-optimization`.

*Default Behavior*
"mean"
Topics::

Examples::
The following method block

.. code-block::

    method,
     model_pointer = 'HIERARCH'
            multilevel_sampling
       pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
       convergence_tolerance = .01
       allocation_target = variance


uses the variance as sample allocation target by computing its variance.
