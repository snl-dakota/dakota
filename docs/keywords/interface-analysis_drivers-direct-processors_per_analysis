Specify the number of processors per analysis when Dakota is run in parallel
Description::
For direct function interfaces, ``processors_per_analysis`` can be used
to specify multiprocessor analysis partitions. As with the
``evaluation_servers``, ``analysis_servers``,
``evaluation_self_scheduling``, ``evaluation_static_scheduling``,
``analysis_self_scheduling``, and ``analysis_static_scheduling``
specifications, ``processors_per_analysis`` provides a means for the
user to override the automatic parallel configuration (refer to
ParallelLibrary and the :ref:`Parallel Computing section <parallel>`)
for the number of processors used for each analysis partition.

*Usage Tips*

- If both ``analysis_servers`` and ``processors_per_analysis`` are     specified and they are not in agreement, then ``analysis_servers``     takes precedence.
