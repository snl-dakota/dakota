Blurb::
Activate adaptive procedure for determining the best basis order
Description::
This option activates a cross validation procedure to
select the best basis order for representing the current set of data.
It searches from ``start_order`` to ``max_order`` in increments of
``kick_order``.

*Default Behavior*

No cross validation for basis order.
Topics::

Examples::
This example shows specification of an order adaptation starting at order 2,
incrementing by 2, and limited at order 6.

.. code-block::

    model,
     id_model = 'FT'
     surrogate global function_train
       start_rank = 4
       adapt_order  start_order = 2  kick_order = 2  max_order = 6
       solver_tolerance   = 1e-12
       rounding_tolerance = 1e-12
     dace_method_pointer = 'SAMPLING'


Note that ``adapt_rank`` and ``adapt_order`` can either be combined or
used separately.
