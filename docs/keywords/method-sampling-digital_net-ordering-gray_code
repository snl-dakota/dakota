Blurb::
Gray code ordering of the points of this digital net

Description::
Returns the points in Gray code order.

*Usage tips*

The advantage of the Gray code ordering is that one can 
generate a good point set with an arbitrary number of points :math:`N`.

Gray code ordering has an additional advantage in that there exists an iterative procedure by Antonov and Saleev :cite:p:`Antonov79` to generate the points of the sequence. 
Knowing the current point with index :math:`n`, the next point with index :math:`n + 1` is obtained by XOR'ing the current point with the :math:`j`\ th column of the 
:math:`i`\ th generating matrix, i.e.,

.. math:: x_{n+1, i} = x_{n, i} \oplus C_{i, j}

where :math:`j` is the rightmost zero-bit of :math:`n` (the position of the bit that 
will change from :math:`n` to :math:`n+1` in Gray code).
