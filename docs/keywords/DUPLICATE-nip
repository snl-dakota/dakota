Use a nonlinear interior point method for solving an optimization sub-problem

Description::
Many uncertainty quantification methods solve a constrained
optimization problem under the hood.  The ``nip`` keyword directs
Dakota to use a nonlinear interior point algorithm to solve the subproblem.
A nonlinear interior point method traverses the interior of the feasible
region to arrive at the optimal solution.
