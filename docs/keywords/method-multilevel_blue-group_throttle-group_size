Blurb::
Throttle multilevel BLUE to only search over groups of a maximum size

Description::
The number of groups in ML BLUE includes all group combinations with a
number of members that do not exceed the size specification.  The
throttle results in slower growth in the number of groups as the total
number of models increases, but the growth is still combinatorial.  As
such, this throttle is generally less restrictive than the other two
options which grow linearly.
