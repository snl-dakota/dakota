Use absolute statistical metrics for assessing convergence in adaptive UQ methods

Description::
When adaptively refining a UQ method (e.g., sample allocations for
metric estimation or surrogate training), the ``absolute`` option
indicates that the metric is not scaled relative to a benchmark, such
that the statistical metric is compared directly to the convergence
tolerance.
