Blurb::
Specify a sub-sampling of the MCMC chain
Description::
If a ``sub_sampling_period`` is specified, the MCMC chain is filtered such that
only the sample at the beginning of each period is in the final MCMC chain.
The ``sub_sampling_period`` should therefore be greater than or equal to the
correlation length of the samples.

*Default Behavior*

If not specified, all MCMC samples are included in the final chain.

*Expected Output*

If specified, an additional tabular output file containing the final (sub-
sampled) MCMC chain is generated.
Topics::
Examples::
Generate and then filter a 1000 sample MCMC chain, retainining the
first accepted sample and every 100th sample thereafter.
