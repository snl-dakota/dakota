Type of solver for forming function train approximations by regression
Description::
Function train approximations are formed based on regression for the set of
coefficients described at :dakkw:`model-surrogate-global-function_train`.  Solver
options include least squares and regularized regression, where the latter
penalizes high-order terms to mitigate overfitting.

*Default Behavior*

The default regression solver is least squares.
