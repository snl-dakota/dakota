Blurb::
Natural ordering of the points of this rank-1 lattice

Description::
Returns the points in natural order.

*Usage Tips*

When the ``natural`` ordering of the points is used, it is implicitly assumed that the user will 
only request a number of points that is a power of 2. Failing to do so will result in a set of points 
for which one or more dimensions are not uniformly covered, resulting in bad low-discrepancy properties, 
and ultimately bad performance of the method that uses these points. It is recommended to not use this option unless you know what you're doing.

              m_max 3 # 8 points in total
              no_random_shift
              ordering natural # this is fine since we generate 2^3 = 8 samples
