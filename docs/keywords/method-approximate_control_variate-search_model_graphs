Perform a recursion of admissible DAGs for a given model ensemble

Description::
Within the context of generalized ACV (:cite:p:`Bomarito2022`),
search over a set of admissible directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for a
given model ensemble.  The DAG with the best performance (lowest
estimator variance for a prescribed budget or lowest cost for a
prescribed accuracy) is selected for final post-processing.

In order of increasing numbers of DAGs to enumate, options include
``kl_recursion``, ``partial_recursion`` with a ``depth_limit``, and
``full_recursion``.
