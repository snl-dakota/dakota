Blurb::
(Default) Use internal Dakota finite differences algorithm
Description::
The ``dakota`` routine is the default since it can execute
in parallel and exploit the concurrency in finite difference
evaluations (see the discussion on :ref:`exploiting parallelism <parallel:overview:cat>`).

When the ``method_source`` is ``dakota``, the user may also specify the
type of scaling desired when determining the finite difference step
size. The choices are ``absolute``, ``bounds``, and ``relative``. For
``absolute``, the step size will be applied as is. For ``bounds``, it
will be scaled by the range of each parameter. For ``relative``, it
will be scaled by the parameter value.
