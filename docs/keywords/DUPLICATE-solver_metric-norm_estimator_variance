Blurb::
Utilize a p-norm over the vector of QoI estimator variances as the solver metric for sampling-based multifidelity methods.

Description::
The p-norm option provides more flexibility in defining a middle
ground between the average and max options for scalar reduction of the
estimator variance vector.  As the order of the norm increases, the
metric approaches the max option (the infinity norm).  The default
norm order is 2.
