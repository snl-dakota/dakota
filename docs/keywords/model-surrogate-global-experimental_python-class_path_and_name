Specify the module and class name of the python surrogate

Description::
Specify the module and class name of the python surrogate.
At minimum, the class must contain the methods 'construct' and 'predict'.
Dakota passes to the former a matrix (num samples x num variables)
of variable values and a num samples x 1 matrix of responses to use
to train the surrogate.  The `predict` method receives a matrix of num
samples x num variables and expects a matrix of num samples x 1 predicted
values to be returned.  An optional 'gradient' method is supported as
well and returns gradients for a matrix of variables passed from Dakota.

Examples::

Use of python-based surrogates in Dakota is enabled via:

.. code-block::

  model,
      id_model = 'SURR'
      surrogate global,
      dace_method_pointer = 'DACE'
      experimental_python
          class_path_and_name = "surrogate_polynomial.Surrogate"

An corresponding python class (incomplete) would contain at minimum:

.. code-block::

  class Surrogate:

    def construct(self, var, resp):
        var2 = np.hstack((np.ones((var.shape[0], 1)), var))
        self.coeffs = np.zeros(var.shape[1])
        z = np.linalg.inv(np.dot(var2.T, var2))
        self.coeffs = np.dot(z, np.dot(var2.T, resp))
        return

    def predict(self, pts):
        return self.coeffs[0]+pts.dot(self.coeffs[1:])
