Perform a search over admissible model relationships for a given model ensemble

Description::
Referring to generalized ACV
(:dakkw:`method-approximate_control_variate-search_model_graphs` and
:cite:p:`Bomarito2022`), MFMC is a special case of generalized ACV-MF
(:dakkw:`method-approximate_control_variate-acv_multifidelity) where a
hierarchical DAG is employed across the model approximations.  As such,
a MFMC method specification that includes graph search forwards to the
generalized ACV solver, but with fixing the DAG to be hierarchical
(each approximation node points to the next approximation of higher
fidelity/resolution, ending with the truth model at the root node) and
fixing the sampling scheme to be ACV-MF.

While the use of a hierarchical DAG is required, the approximation
selections and orderings within this DAG can be varied, so generalized
ACV capabilities for model graph search (see
:dakkw:`method-multifidelity_sampling-search_model_graphs-full_recursion`)
and model selection (see
:dakkw:`method-multifidelity_sampling-search_model_graphs-model_selection`)
are available.
