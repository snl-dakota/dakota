Use the Adaptive Metropolis MCMC algorithm
Description::
This keyword specifies the use of the Adaptive Metropolis algorithm.
That is, the "AM" part of DRAM is used but the "DR" part is not:
specifying this keyword activates only the Adaptive Metropolis part of
the MCMC algorithm, in which the covariance of the proposal density is
updated adaptively.

*Default Behavior*

Five MCMC algorithm variants are supported in QUESO: ``dram``,
``delayed_rejection``, ``adaptive_metropolis``, ``metropolis_hastings``, and
``multilevel``.  The default is ``dram``.

Four MCMC variants are currently supported in MUQ: ``dram``,
``delayed_rejection``, ``metropolis_hastings`` and ``adaptive_metropolis``.

*Usage Tips*

If the user knows very little about the proposal covariance, but
doesn't want to incur the cost of using full dram with both delayed
rejection and adaptive metropolis, specifying only
``adaptive_metropolis`` offers a good strategy.
