Use a sequential quadratic programming method for solving an optimization sub-problem

Description::
Many uncertainty quantification methods solve a constrained
optimization problem under the hood.  The ``sqp`` keyword directs
Dakota to use a sequential quadratic programming method to solve the
subproblem.  A sequential quadratic programming solves a sequence of
linearly-constrained quadratic programming problems to arrive at the
optimal solution.
