Whether to minimize or maximize each objective function
Description::
The ``sense`` keyword is used to declare whether each objective function
should be minimized or maximized.  The argument options are:

- ``"minimization"`` (can be abbreviated to "min")
- ``"maximization"`` (can be abbreviated to "max")

If a single string is specified it will apply to each objective
function.  Otherwise, the number of strings should either be equal to
the number of objective functions (
:dakkw:`responses-objective_functions`). Thus, when scalar and/or field
responses are specified, the number of ``sense`` strings must equal the
number of scalars plus the number of fields, *not* the total elements
in the fields.
