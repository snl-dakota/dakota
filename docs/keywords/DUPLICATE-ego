Use the Efficient Global Optimization method
Description::
In the case of ``ego``, the efficient global optimization (EGO) method
is used to calculate bounds. By default, the Surfpack GP (Kriging)
model is used, but the Dakota implementation may be selected
instead. If ``use_derivatives`` is specified the GP model will be built
using available derivative data (Surfpack GP only).

See :dakkw:`method-efficient_global` for more information.
