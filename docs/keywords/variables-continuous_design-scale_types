How to scale each continuous design variable
Description::
Each string in ``scale_types`` indicates the scaling type for each
continuous design variable. They only have effect when the associated
method specifies ``scaling``.

The options are:


- <tt>'value'</tt> - characteristic value by which variables will be     divided. If this is chosen, then     :dakkw:`variables-continuous_design-scales` must also be specified; 'value'     is assumed if scales are given without ``scale_types``
- <tt>'auto'</tt> - automatic scaling based on bounds.
- <tt>'log'</tt> - logarithmic scaling (can be used together with     :dakkw:`variables-continuous_design-scales`).

If a single string is specified it will apply to all continuous design
variables. Otherwise, a scale type must be specified for each
continuous design variable.

*Usage Tips:*

See the scaling information under specific methods, e.g.,
``method-*-scaling`` for details on how to use this keyword.

Examples::
Two continuous design variables, one scaled by 4.0, the other by 0.1,
then further log scaled:

.. code-block::

      continuous_design = 2
        initial_point    -1.2      1.0
        lower_bounds     -2.0      0.001
        upper_bounds      2.0      2.0
        descriptors       'x1'     "x2"
        scale_types =     'value' 'log'
        scales =          4.0      0.1
