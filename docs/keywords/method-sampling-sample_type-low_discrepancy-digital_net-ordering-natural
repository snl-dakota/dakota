Blurb::
Natural ordering of the points of this digital net

Description::
Returns the points in natural order.

When the :dakkw:`natural` ordering of the points is used, it is implicitly assumed that the user will 
only request a number of points that is a power of 2. Failing to do so will result in a set of points 
for which one or more dimensions are not uniformly covered, resulting in bad low-discrepancy properties, 
and ultimately bad performance of the method that uses these points. It is recommended to not use this option unless you know what you're doing.
