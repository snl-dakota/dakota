Run Scilab through a direct interface - requires special Dakota build
Description::
Dakota supports :ref:`a library-linked interface to Scilab <advint:scilab>`, which
may not be available in pre-built downloads of Dakota and must be explicitly enabled when
compiling Dakota from source.

The :dakkw:`interface-analysis_drivers` specifies a Scilab file which
implements the parameter to response mapping.
