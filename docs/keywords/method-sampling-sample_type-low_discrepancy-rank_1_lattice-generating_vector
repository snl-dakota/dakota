Specify the generating vector of this rank-1 lattice rule

Description::
There are three ways in which a user can specify a generating vector:

- an inline generating vector (with the keyword :dakkw:`method-sampling-sample_type-low_discrepancy-rank_1_lattice-generating_vector-inline`)
- a generating vector read from an external file (with the keyword :dakkw:`method-sampling-sample_type-low_discrepancy-rank_1_lattice-generating_vector-file`)
- a predefined generating vector (with the keyword :dakkw:`method-sampling-sample_type-low_discrepancy-rank_1_lattice-generating_vector-predefined`)

One of these options must be specified if the ``generating_vector`` keyword is provided.
