Specify the generating vector of this rank-1 lattice rule

Description::
There are three ways in which a user can specify a generating vector:
- an inline generating vector (with the keyword :dakkw:`inline`)
- a generating vector read from an external file (with the keyword :dakkw:`file`:)
- a predefined generating vector (with the keyword :dakkw:`predefined`:)
One of these options must be specified if the ``generating_vector`` keyword is provided.
