  abstract = {The Compressed Sensing framework aims to recover a sparse signal
  from a small set of projections onto random vectors; the problem reduces to
  searching for a sparse approximation of this measurement vector. Conventional
  solutions involve linear programming or greedy algorithms and can be
  computationally expensive. These techniques are generic, however, and assume
  no structure in the signal aside from sparsity. In this paper, we design an
  algorithm that enables fast recovery of piecewise smooth signals, sparse
  signals that have distinct {\textquotedblleft}connected
  tree{\textquotedblright} structure in the wavelet domain. Our Tree Matching
  Pursuit (TMP) algorithm significantly reduces the search space of the
  traditional Matching Pursuit greedy algorithm, resulting in a substantial
  decrease in computational complexity for recovering piecewise smooth signals.
  An additional advantage of TMP is that it performs an implicit egularization
  to combat noise in the reconstruction. TMP also applies to the more general
  case of {\textquotedblleft}incoherent{\textquotedblright} measurement
  vectors.}
