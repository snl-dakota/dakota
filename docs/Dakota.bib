  abstract = {The Compressed Sensing framework aims to recover a sparse signal
  from a small set of projections onto random vectors; the problem reduces to
  searching for a sparse approximation of this measurement vector. Conventional
  solutions involve linear programming or greedy algorithms and can be
  computationally expensive. These techniques are generic, however, and assume
  no structure in the signal aside from sparsity. In this paper, we design an
  algorithm that enables fast recovery of piecewise smooth signals, sparse
  signals that have distinct {\textquotedblleft}connected
  tree{\textquotedblright} structure in the wavelet domain. Our Tree Matching
  Pursuit (TMP) algorithm significantly reduces the search space of the
  traditional Matching Pursuit greedy algorithm, resulting in a substantial
  decrease in computational complexity for recovering piecewise smooth signals.
  An additional advantage of TMP is that it performs an implicit egularization
  to combat noise in the reconstruction. TMP also applies to the more general
  case of {\textquotedblleft}incoherent{\textquotedblright} measurement
  vectors.}

Central moments play a central role in many  disciplines to characterize a random system output's  distribution and are of primary importance in many  prediction, optimization, and decision making processes  under uncertainties. We detail how to effectively tune the  MLMC algorithm for central moments of any order and present  a complete practical algorithm that is implemented in our  accompanying Python library cmlmc-py1. In fact, we validate  the methodology on selected reference problems and apply it  to an aerodynamic relevant test case, namely the transonic  RAE 2822 airfoil affected by operating and geometric  uncertain- ties.},
