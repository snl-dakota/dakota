A subordinate local method provides periodic refinements to a top-level global method
Description::
In the \c embedded approach, a tightly-coupled
hybrid is employed in which 
a subordinate local method provides periodic refinements to a top-level global method. 

Global and local method strings supplied
with the \c global_method_pointer and \c local_method_pointer
specifications identify the two methods to be used. The \c
local_search_probability setting is an optional specification for
supplying the probability (between 0.0 and 1.0) of employing local
search to improve estimates within the global search.
