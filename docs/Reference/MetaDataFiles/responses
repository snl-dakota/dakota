Blurb::
Denotes a data request from an iterator that is mapped through an interface in a single pass.
Description::
The \c responses specification in a Dakota input file controls
the types of data that can be returned from an interface during
Dakota's execution. The specification includes three groups and two
optional keywords.

<b> Group 1 </b> is related to the number and type of responses expected by Dakota

The function specification must be one of three types: 
-# a group
containing objective and constraint functions, 
-# a group containing
calibration (least squares) terms and constraint functions, or 
-# a generic response functions specification. These function sets
correspond to optimization, least squares, and uncertainty
quantification iterators, respectively.

The types of response functions chosen from Group 1
should be consistent with the
iterative technique called for in the method specification.
Certain general-purpose iterative techniques, such as parameter
studies and design of experiments methods, can be used with any of
these data sets.

Each type of response has additional required and optional 
keywords.

<b> Group 2 </b> is related to the availability of first 
derivatives (gradient vectors) for the response
functions.

The gradient specification also links back to the iterative method
used. Gradients commonly are needed when the iterative
study involves gradient-based optimization, reliability analysis for
uncertainty quantification, or local sensitivity analysis.


<b> Group 3 </b> is related to the availability of second
derivatives (Hessian matrices) for the response
functions.

Hessian availability for the response functions is similar to the
gradient availability specifications, with the addition of support
for "quasi-Hessians":

The Hessian specification also links back to the iterative method in
use; Hessians commonly would be used in gradient-based
optimization by full Newton methods or in reliability analysis
with second-order limit state approximations or second-order
probability integrations.

Examples::
Several examples follow. The first example shows an optimization data
set containing an objective function and two nonlinear inequality
constraints. These three functions have analytic gradient availability
and no Hessian availability.

\verbatim
responses,
	objective_functions = 1
	nonlinear_inequality_constraints = 2
	analytic_gradients
	no_hessians
\endverbatim

The next example shows a typical specification for a calibration data
set. The six residual functions will have numerical gradients computed
using the dakota finite differencing routine with central differences
of 0.1% (plus/minus delta value = .001*value).

\verbatim
responses,
	calibration_terms = 6
	numerical_gradients
	  method_source dakota
	  interval_type central
	  fd_gradient_step_size = .001
	no_hessians
\endverbatim

The last example shows a specification that could be used with a
nondeterministic sampling iterator. The three response functions have no
gradient or Hessian availability; therefore, only function values will
be used by the iterator.

\verbatim
responses,
	response_functions = 3
	no_gradients
	no_hessians
\endverbatim

Parameter study and design of experiments iterators are not restricted
in terms of the response data sets which may be catalogued; they may
be used with any of the function specification examples shown above.


Theory::
Responses specify the total data set that is available for use by the method over the course of iteration. This is distinguished from the data subset described by an active set vector (see Dakota File Data Formats in the Users Manual [Adams et al., 2010]) indicating the particular subset of the response data needed for a particular function evaluation. Thus, the responses specification is a broad description of the data to be used during a study whereas the active set vector indicates the subset currently needed.
