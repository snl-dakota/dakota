Determine how Dakota responds to analysis driver failure
Description::
Dakota can deal with analysis failure in a few ways. However,
the first step is that Dakota must detect analysis failure. 
- Dakota always expects a results file to be written by the analysis driver
- If the file does not exist when the analysis driver exits, a Dakota error results.
- The analysis driver must communicate an analysis failure to Dakota by
  writing a results file beginning with "fail". 
  - This is not case sensitive
  - Everything after fail is ignored

Once Dakota detects analysis failure, the failure can be mitigated in four ways:
- \ref interface-analysis_drivers-failure_capture-abort (the default)
- \ref interface-analysis_drivers-failure_capture-retry
- \ref interface-analysis_drivers-failure_capture-recover
- \ref interface-analysis_drivers-failure_capture-continuation

!!!!!!!!! Why is this stuff below commented out?? !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
<!-- If no failure -->
<!-- capturing specification is provided, then the default behavior is -->
<!-- method dependent. For those iterative algorithms that provide -->
<!-- internal failure mitigation strategies (currently NL2SOL and MOOCHO), -->
<!-- the default is to transfer the failure information from the interface -->
<!-- back to the algorithm for mitigation, with no specific action taken by -->
<!-- %Dakota. For all other algorithms, the default is to abort. -->
