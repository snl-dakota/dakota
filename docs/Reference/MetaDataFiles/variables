Specifies the parameter set to be iterated by a particular method.
Description::
The \c variables specification in a Dakota input file specifies the 
parameter set to be iterated by a particular method. 

In the case of 
- An optimization study:
 - These variables are adjusted in order to locate an optimal design.
- Parameter studies/sensitivity analysis/design of experiments: 
 - These parameters are perturbed to explore the parameter space.
- Uncertainty analysis: 
 - The variables are associated with distribution/interval characterizations which are used to compute corresponding distribution/interval characterizations for response functions. 

To accommodate these different studies, Dakota supports different:
- Variable types
 - design
 - aleatory uncertain
 - epistemic uncertain
 - state
- Variable domains
 - continuous 
 - discrete
  - discrete range
  - discrete integer set
  - discrete real set

Use the \ref topic-variables_and_responses page to browse the available variables
by type and domain.


<b> Variable Types </b>
- Design Variables 
  - Design variables are those variables which are modified for the
    purposes of computing an optimal design.
  - The most common type of design variables encountered in engineering
    applications are of the continuous type. These variables may assume
    any real value within
    their bounds.
  - All but a handful of the optimization algorithms in
    Dakota support continuous design variables exclusively.
- Aleatory Uncertain Variables
  - Aleatory uncertainty is also known as inherent variability,
    irreducible uncertainty, or randomness.
  - Aleatory uncertainty is predominantly characterized using 
    probability theory. This is the only option implemented in Dakota.
- Epistemic Uncertain Variables
  - Epistemic uncertainty is uncertainty due to lack of knowledge.
  - In %Dakota, epistemic uncertainty is characterized by interval analysis or the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence.
  - Note that epistemic uncertainty can also be modeled with probability density functions (as done with aleatory uncertainty). 
    Dakota does not support this capability.
- State Variables
  - State variables consist of "other" variables which are to be mapped through
    the simulation interface, in that they are not to be used for design and
    they are not modeled as being uncertain.
  - State variables provide a convenient mechanism for managing additional
    model parameterizations such as mesh density, simulation convergence
    tolerances, and time step controls. 
  - Only parameter studies and design of experiments methods will iterate
    on state variables.
  - The \c initial_value is used as the only value
    for the state variable for all other methods, unless \c active
    \c state is invoked.
  - See more details on the \ref topic-state_variables page.

<b> Variable Domains </b>

Continuous variables are defined by bounds. Discrete variables can be defined in
one of three ways, which are discussed on the page \ref topic-discrete_variables.

<b> Ordering of Variables </b>

The ordering of variables is important, and a consistent ordering 
is employed throughout the Dakota software. It is the same ordering 
as shown in dakota.input.summary 
That ordering can be summarized as 
-# design
 -# continuous 
 -# discrete integer 
 -# discrete real
-# aleatory uncertain
 -# continuous 
 -# discrete integer 
 -# discrete real
-# epistemic uncertain
 -# continuous 
 -# discrete integer 
 -# discrete real
-# state
 -# continuous 
 -# discrete integer 
 -# discrete real

Ordering of variable types below this 
granularity (e.g., from normal to histogram bin within 
aleatory uncertain - continuous ) is defined somewhat arbitrarily, but is 
enforced consistently throughout the code.

Topics:: block, not_yet_reviewed
Examples::
Several examples follow. In the first example, two continuous design
variables are specified:

\verbatim
variables,
	continuous_design = 2
	  initial_point    0.9    1.1
	  upper_bounds     5.8    2.9
	  lower_bounds     0.5   -2.9
	  descriptors   'radius' 'location'
\endverbatim

In the next example, defaults are employed. In this case, \c
initial_point will default to a vector of \c 0. values, \c
upper_bounds will default to vector values of \c DBL_MAX (the
maximum number representable in double precision for a particular
platform, as defined in the platform's \c float.h C header file), \c
lower_bounds will default to a vector of \c -DBL_MAX values, and
\c descriptors will default to a vector of <tt>'cdv_i'</tt>
strings, where \c i ranges from one to two:

\verbatim
variables,
	continuous_design = 2
\endverbatim

In the following example, the syntax for a normal-lognormal
distribution is shown.  One normal and one lognormal uncertain
variable are completely specified by their means and standard
deviations. In addition, the dependence structure between the two
variables is specified using the \c uncertain_correlation_matrix.

\verbatim
variables,
        normal_uncertain    =  1
          means             =  1.0
          std_deviations    =  1.0
          descriptors       =  'TF1n'
        lognormal_uncertain =  1
          means             =  2.0
          std_deviations    =  0.5
          descriptors       =  'TF2ln'
        uncertain_correlation_matrix =  1.0 0.2
                                        0.2 1.0
\endverbatim

An example of the syntax for a state variables specification follows:

\verbatim
variables,
        continuous_state = 1
          initial_state       4.0
          lower_bounds        0.0
          upper_bounds        8.0
          descriptors        'CS1'
        discrete_state_range = 1
          initial_state       104
          lower_bounds        100
          upper_bounds        110
          descriptors        'DS1'
\endverbatim

And in a more advanced example, a variables specification containing a
set identifier, continuous and discrete design variables, normal and
uniform uncertain variables, and continuous and discrete state
variables is shown:

\verbatim
variables,
	id_variables = 'V1'
	continuous_design = 2
	  initial_point    0.9    1.1
	  upper_bounds     5.8    2.9
	  lower_bounds     0.5   -2.9
	  descriptors   'radius' 'location'
	discrete_design_range = 1
	  initial_point    2
	  upper_bounds     1
	  lower_bounds     3
	  descriptors   'material'
	normal_uncertain = 2
	  means          =  248.89, 593.33
	  std_deviations =   12.4,   29.7
	  descriptors    =  'TF1n'   'TF2n'
	uniform_uncertain = 2
	  lower_bounds =  199.3,  474.63
	  upper_bounds =  298.5,  712.
	  descriptors  =  'TF1u'   'TF2u'
	continuous_state = 2
	  initial_state = 1.e-4  1.e-6
	  descriptors   = 'EPSIT1' 'EPSIT2'
	discrete_state_set_int = 1
	  initial_state = 100
	  set_values    = 100 212 375
	  descriptors   = 'load_case'
\endverbatim
