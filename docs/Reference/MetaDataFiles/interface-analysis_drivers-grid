Description::
For grid interfaces, no additional specifications are used at this time.
<!-- \c hostnames and \c processors_per_host are
additional settings within the required group.  The \c hostnames
specification provides a list of machines for use in distributing
evaluations, and the \c processors_per_host specification provides the
number of processors to use from each host. -->
This capability has been used for interfaces with IDEA and JAVASpaces
in the past and is currently a placeholder for future work with Condor
and/or Globus services.  It is not currently operational.
