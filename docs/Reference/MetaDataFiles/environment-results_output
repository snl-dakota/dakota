(Experimental) Write a summary file containing only the final results
Description::
Final results from a %Dakota study can be
output to dakota_results.txt by specifying \c results_output
(optionally specifying an alternate file name with \c
results_output_filename). The current experimental text file format
is hierarchical and a precursor to planned output to structured text
formats such as XML or YAML and binary formats such as HDF5. The
contents, organization, and format of results files are all under
active development and are subject to change.
