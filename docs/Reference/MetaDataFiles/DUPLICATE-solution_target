WRONG??? Specifies a globally optimal value toward which the optimizer should track
Description::
The solution target specifies a goal toward
which the optimizer should track. 

When \c solution_target is
specified, \c convergence_tolerance specifies a percent error on the
optimization. 

This is used for test problems, when the true global
minimum is known (call it \c solution_target := fglobal). Then, the
optimization terminates when 100(f_min-fglobal)/max(1,abs(fglobal) <
convergence_tolerance. The default for fglobal is -1.0e100 and the
default for convergence tolerance is described at \ref method-convergence_tolerance.
