readme      SVGA drivers for PLplot using the emx/gcc compiler     7-Jan-1995
=============================================================================

	emx0.9a (gcc 2.6.3)
	svgakit/vesakit 1.7 (Johannes Martin)

See "readme.emx" for information on obtaining the above.

The final executables run in Dos or Dos mode of OS/2.
Forget about trying to run in a Windows Dos box.


To compile everything under Dos simply:
	dos> .\mkmf
	dos> .\link main stubs
	dos> cd tmp
	dos> make
	dos> make install

To compile on an NFS mounted drive is only slightly more complicated:

	unix% ./mkmf
	unix% ./link main stubs NFS
	dos> cd tmp
	dos> make
	dos> make install
	
the "NFS" *must* follow "main", since it renames the mixed-case headers
	plplotP.h	plplotTK.h	plplotX.h	tclMatrix.h
that would otherwise be re-mapped strangely on the NFS mount.
Similarly, the directory "examples/C" should be renamed "examples/c".

The install can provide the stubs for FORTRAN via "f2c", the fortran-to-C
converter.  Set the "enable_f77" variable to "yes" in ./mkmf.bat to install
the f2c stubs.  I have not personally tested this, but it is said to work
with the djgpp/gcc port; you'll need the m4 preprocessor for the Fortran
examples.

The makefiles have been tested and work with dmake3.8 and GNU make.
The only Unix-ish tool that is required by the makefile(s) is an
`rm' that understands forward-slashes to remove the library target.

The default installations are
plplot library:		c:/usr/local/plplot/lib
demo programmes:	c:/usr/local/plplot/demos

These locations can be changed in the ./cf/init.in file.
(Please note the Unix and Dos name types and change BOTH.)

To compile the demos:
	dos> cd DEMOS_DIR/c
	dos> make cdemos
	dos> make bind

The final step is to enable port and memory access for the VESA driver.
If a demo executable core dumps when you use "-dev vga", it is probably
because you forgot the final binding step.

Other customizations:

 - pldevs.h
   Define the appropriate macro to enable the corresponding output driver.

 - plconfig.h
   Define (string) values for LIB_DIR, BIN_DIR, and TCL_DIR if you want
   plplot to look somewhere other than the hardwired or
   environmentally-set locations for the files it needs.
   These values (and/or the environment variables) should be in
   forward-slash UNIX style, but can include a drive specifier.
   eg,	#define LIB_DIR "c:/usr/local/plplot/lib/"

Thanks to Paul Kirschner (pek@utrc.utc.com) for the djgpp configuration
which provided a basis for this one.

Notes on the driver:
      -	Since I have only tested this on a DOS system, I used 
	the _read_kbd() function which OS/2 users may want to avoid
	and the final bind options for executables may be adjusting.

      -	The driver uses the "-geometry" command-line option to provide
	control over the video resolution (details in the driver code).
