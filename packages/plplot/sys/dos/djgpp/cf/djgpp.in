# First time only, should be executed from $(PLTMP)

# The following lines can be changed to add optional features to the DJGPP
# GNUSVGA driver running under GRX20 (23 actually)
# What they do is allow you to dump the image on the screen to a graphics
# file.

# With GRX23, Windows bitmap support comes standard, but it is bugged.
# You have to set the number of colours in the "grx20drv" environmental
# variable to "nc 256". Then it will work, otherwise a 16.5 million colour
# map is made, and all colours are black (not good).
# It makes bitmaps that are *fat*. Not nice. It's here because its easy and
# costs nothing, and if your too lazy to download and compile the TIFF
# library, then its the next best thing. Just hit "F12" when the
# image is on screen, and it will be dumped to a file with an odd name
# in the current directory. If you have the TIFF library, I would
# personally turn off bitmap support.
# To Turn on support for dumping as bitmaps,
# make sure the next line is uncommented

GRX_DO_BMP = 1

# If you want to add a "stand alone" BMP device driver (in addition to or
# instead of the screen-dump) edit "pldev.h" and make sure "PLD_bmp" is
# defined.


# The Windows bitmaps are FAT and ugly. TIFF files are much smaller and
# nicer. GRX23 sort of has support for TIFFLIB, if you compile an extra
# module in your build. TIFFLIB is available from:
#        ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff
#        http://www.earthlink.net/~ritter/tiff/
# There is one small error in the compile. I can't remember what, but it is
# easy to fix in the makefile. It is just an incorrectly set flag. Other
# versions of TIFFLIB than the one I used might even have it fixed.
# If you want to go to the trouble of downloading and compiling the library
# (and it IS worth it), then your in for a treat.
# This library works like a charm, and saves some very nice small screen
# images. Just hit "F10" to make it work if there is an image on screen
# To Turn on support for dumping as TIFFs,
# make sure the next line is uncommented

#GRX_DO_TIFF = 1

# If you want to add a "stand alone" TIFF device driver (in addition to or
# instead of the screen-dump) edit "pldev.h" and make sure "PLD_tiff" is
# defined, then make sure the next line is uncommented

#LDC_LIBS_TIFF =-ltiff

# Well, you can save them babies as JPEGs as well. Why ? Well, you can.
# I would seriously recommend you downloading the TIFF library and using that
# instead though. PLPLOT only really uses 16/256 colours most of the time
# and even though the JPEG support works, and will save the image as a JPEG,
# it will be big (lots bigger than the TIFF) and ugly ! I only did this
# because I have the JPEG library on my system; didn't have the TIFF lib
# (then); and, was lazy. It was an unsuccessful experiment, but since I
# did it, I kept it. It uses the Independent JPEG Group's libjpeg library
#            ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz
# Just hit "F11" while an image is on the screen, and it will dump the file.
# To Turn on support for saving as JPEGs, make sure the
# next line is uncommented

#GRX_DO_JPEG = 1

# If you want to add a "stand alone" JPEG device driver (in addition to or
# instead of the screen-dump) then you have two choices.
# First, there is the GRX23 JPEG driver. That is has a small amount
# of overhead on top of the screen dump feature. It is the better of
# the two JPEG drivers for DOS, so if you want that driver make sure
# "PLD_jpg" is defined in "pldev.h". The second JPEG driver is part of GD,
# which itself is used by the PNG driver. If you *really* want to use
# GD's JPEG driver (ie if you are also using the PNG driver), then make
# sure "PLD_jpeg" is defined in "pldev.h". If you are using GD's JPEG
# driver, you will have to activate and install the PNG libraries as well.
# Regardless of which JPEG driver you select (and if you *really* want, you
# can have both), make sure the next line is uncommented

#LDC_LIBS_JPEG =-ljpeg

# If you want to use the PNG device driver, or the JPEG driver that runs
# from GD (ie PLD_jpeg), you will need to make sure that you have
# compiled and installed libpng, libgd, and libz.
# Details about obtaining these libraries can be found at:
#               http://www.boutell.com/gd/    ;  and
#               http://www.libpng.org
# Even if you are NOT using the PNG driver, its library is needed if
# you want to use GD's JPEG driver rather than GRX23's JPEG driver.
# To activate the PNG driver, edit "pldev.h" and define "PLD_png".
# Then make sure the next line is uncommented

#LDC_LIBS_PNG=-lgd -lpng -lz

# If you want to use the CGM device driver, you will need to make
# sure that you have compiled and installed libcd. Details about
# obtaining libcd can be found at:
#  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2915
#                        or
#  http://www.pa.msu.edu/reference/cgmdraw_ref.html
#
# To activate the CGM driver, edit "pldev.h" and define "PLD_cgm".
# Then make sure the next line is uncommented:

#LDC_LIBS_CGM=-lcd

# If you want freetype compliant drivers (including the screen driver)
# activated, then make sure you have compiled and built freetype, which is
# available from www.freetype.org, then uncomment the next line:

#HAVE_FREETYPE=1

# If your freetype library has some other name, naturally change it !

ifdef HAVE_FREETYPE
LDC_LIBS_FREETYPE :=-lfreetype
