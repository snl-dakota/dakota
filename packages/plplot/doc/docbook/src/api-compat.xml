  <title>API compatibility definition</title>

  <para>
    This chapter presents the formal definition of what is considered to be
    in the PLplot library API.  It is assumed that major new releases of
    PLplot will have substantial backwards incompatible changes in the API,
    but the PLplot developers commit to introducing as few as possible of
    such incompatibilities between minor releases such that stability
    across those minor releases is practically guaranteed.  In all cases
    where backwards incompatible changes have been introduced, then the
    library soname will be changed (for operating systems such as Linux
    that support versioned shared libraries).
  </para>

  <para>
    The information in this chapter regards version &Project-Version; of
    PLplot, released on &Release-Date;.

    <title>
      What is in the API?
    </title>

    <para>
      The formal definition of the PLplot C API is everything that is defined
      in the include file <filename>plplot.h</filename>.  This includes all
      the function prototypes, the defined structures and the semantics of
      the constants.  The list of symbols currently exported by the shared
      library <filename>libplplot.h</filename> that are declared in
      <filename>plplot.h</filename> is the following:
    </para>

    <para>
      <programlisting>&plplot-symbols;</programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      Another important aspect of compatibility regard the Application
      Binary Interface (ABI).  Backwards compatibility can be broken by
      changes in the C structures made public through
      <filename>plplot.h</filename>.  Currently, they are:

    <para>
      <programlisting>&plplot-structs;</programlisting>

    <title>
      Regression test for backwards compatibility
    </title>

    <para>
      Since PLplot is developed by so many people, the task of checking for
      backwards compatiblity of the library is very hard.  As for the 5.3.1
      release, we do not have any rigorous regression test for check
      whether the library is really backwards compatible.
    </para>

    <para>
      However, here are some rules to be followed by the Release Manager
      prior to releasing a new version of PLplot:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Check if there are any changes in
            <filename>plplot.h</filename>.  If no prototype is changed,
            then the chances are high that no backwards compatibilities
            have been introduced.  If new functions has been added, then
            the library soname will be kept, although the libtool soversion
            string in <filename>configure.ac</filename> must be changed
            from <literal>x:y:z</literal> to
            <literal>(x+1):0:(z+1)</literal>.  See the
            <application>libtool</application> manual for details.
        </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            A necessary, but not sufficient test consists of the following:
            first, install the previous released version of PLplot in the
            system and compile all the examples
            <filename>examples/c/x??c.</filename>.  After that, install the
            to-be-released version of PLplot and try to run the previously
            compiled examples.  If they either link or run incorrectly,
            then backwards incompatibilities have been introduced and the
            soversion string must be upgraded from <literal>x:y:z</literal>
            to <literal>(x+1):0:0</literal>.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
