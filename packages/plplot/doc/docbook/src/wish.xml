  <title>Building an Extended WISH</title>
  
  <para>
    Beginning with PLplot 5.0, a new and powerful paradigm for interaction
    with PLplot is introduced.  This new paradigm consists of an
    integration of PLplot with a powerful scripting language (Tcl), and
    extensions to that language to support X Windows interface development
    (Tk) and object oriented programming ([incr Tcl]).  Taken together,
    these four software systems (Tcl/Tk/itcl/PLplot) comprise a powerful
    environment for the rapid prototyping and development of sophisticated,
    flexible, X Windows applications with access to the PLplot API.  Yet
    that is only the beginning&mdash;Tcl was born to be extended.  The true
    power of this paradigm is achieved when you add your own, powerful,
    application specific extensions to the above quartet, thus creating an
    environment for the development of wholly new applications with only a
    few keystrokes of shell programming ...

    <title>Introduction to Tcl</title>
    
    <para>
      The Tool Command Language, or just Tcl (pronounced
      <quote>tickle</quote>) is an embeddable script language which can be
      used to control a wide variety of applications.  Designed by John
      Ousterhout of UC Berkeley, Tcl is freely available under the standard
      Berkeley copyright.  Tcl and Tk (described below) are extensively
      documented in a new book published by Addison Wesley, entitled
      <quote>Tcl and the Tk toolkit</quote> by John Ousterhout.  This book
      is a must have for those interested in developing powerful extensible
      applications with high quality X Windows user interfaces.  The
      discussion in this chapter cannot hope to approach the level of
      introduction provided by that book.  Rather we will concentrate on
      trying to convey some of the excitement, and show the nuts and bolts
      of using Tcl and some extensions to provide a powerful and flexible
      interface to the PLplot library within your application.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="motivation-tcl">
      <title>Motivation for Tcl</title>
      
      <para>
	The central observation which led Ousterhout to create Tcl was the
	realization that many applications require the use of some sort of
	a special purpose, application specific, embedded <quote>macro
	language</quote>.  Application programmers cobble these <quote>tiny
	languages</quote> into their codes in order to provide flexibility
	and some modicum of high level control.  But the end result is
	frequently a quirky and fragile language.  And each application has
	a different <quote>tiny language</quote> associated with it.  The
	idea behind Tcl, then, was to create a single <quote>core
	language</quote> which could be easily embedded into a wide variety
	of applications.  Further, it should be easily extensible so that
	individual applications can easily provide application specific
	capabilities available in the macro language itself, while still
	providing a robust, uniform syntax across a variety of
	applications.  To say that Tcl satisfies these requirements would
	be a spectacular understatement.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2 id="capabilities-tcl">
      <title>Capabilities of Tcl</title>
      
      <para>
	The mechanics of using Tcl are very straightforward.  Basically you
	just have to include the file <filename>tcl.h</filename>, issue
	some API calls to create a Tcl interpreter, and then evaluate a
	script file or perform other operations supported by the Tcl API.
	Then just link against <filename>libtcl.a</filename> and off you
	go.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	Having done this, you have essentially created a shell.  That is, your
	program can now execute shell scripts in the Tcl language.  Tcl
	provides support for basic control flow, variable substitution file
	i/o and subroutines.  In addition to the builtin Tcl commands, you can
	define your own subroutines as Tcl procedures which effectively
	become new keywords.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	But the real power of this approach is to add new commands to the
	interpreter which are realized by compiled C code in your
	application.  Tcl provides a straightforward API call which allows
	you to register a function in your code to be called whenever the
	interpreter comes across a specific keyword of your choosing in
	the shell scripts it executes.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	This facility allows you with tremendous ease, to endow your
	application with a powerful, robust and full featured macro
	language, trivially extend that macro language with new keywords
	which trigger execution of compiled application specific commands,
	and thereby raise the level of interaction with your code to one of
	essentially shell programming via script editing.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2 id="acquiring-tcl">
      <title>Acquiring Tcl</title>
      
      <para>
	There are several important sources of info and code for Tcl.
	Definitely get the book mentioned above.  The Tcl and Tk toolkits
	are distributed by anonymous <command>ftp</command> at <ulink
	url="ftp://sprite.berkeley.edu/tcl"><filename>sprite.berkeley.edu:/tcl</filename></ulink>.
	There are several files in there corresponding to Tcl, Tk, and
	various forms of documentation.  At the time of this writing, the
	current versions of Tcl and Tk are 7.3 and 3.6 respectively.
	Retrieve those files, and install using the instructions provided
	therein.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	The other major anonymous <command>ftp</command> site for Tcl is
	<ulink
	url="ftp://harbor.ecn.purdue.edu/pub/tcl"><filename>harbor.ecn.purdue.edu:/pub/tcl</filename></ulink>.
	Harbor contains a mirror of <literal>sprite</literal> as well as
	innumerable extensions, Tcl/Tk packages, tutorials, documentation,
	etc.  The level of excitement in the Tcl community is
	extraordinarily high, and this is reflected by the great plethora
	of available, high quality, packages and extensions available for
	use with Tcl and Tk.  Explore&mdash;there is definitely something
	for everyone.
      </para>
      
      <para>
	Additionally there is a newsgroup, <literal>comp.lang.tcl</literal>
	which is well read, and an excellent place for people to get
	oriented, find help, etc.  Highly recommended.
      </para>

      <para> In any event, in order to use the Tk driver in PLplot, you will
	need Tcl-8.2 and Tk-8.2 (or higher versions). Additionally, in order
	to use the extended WISH paradigm (described below) you will need
	iTcl-3.1 (or a higher version).
      </para>

      <para>
	However, you will quite likely find Tcl/Tk to be very addictive,
	and the great plethora of add-ons available at
	<literal>harbor</literal> will undoubtedly attract no small amount
	of your attention.  It has been our experience that all of these
	extensions fit together very well.  You will find that there are
	large sectors of the Tcl user community which create so-called
	<quote>MegaWishes</quote> which combine many of the available
	extensions into a single, heavily embellished, shell interpreter.
	The benefits of this approach will become apparent as you gain
	experience with Tcl and Tk.
      </para>

  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="introduction-tk">
    <title>Introduction to Tk</title>
    
    <para>
      As mentioned above, Tcl is designed to be extensible.  The first and
      most basic Tcl extension is Tk, an X11 toolkit.  Tk provides the same
      basic facilities that you may be familiar with from other X11
      toolkits such as Athena and Motif, except that they are provided in
      the context of the Tcl language.  There are C bindings too, but these
      are seldom needed&mdash;the vast majority of useful Tk applications
      can be coded using Tcl scripts.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      If it has not become obvious already, it is worth noting at this
      point that Tcl is one example of a family of languages known
      generally as <quote>Very High Level Languages</quote>, or VHLL's.
      Essentially a VHLL raises the level of programming to a very high
      level, allowing very short token streams to accomplish as much as
      would be required by many scores of the more primitive actions
      available in a basic HLL.  Consider, for example, the basic
      <quote>Hello World!</quote> application written in Tcl/Tk.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      <programlisting>
#!/usr/local/bin/wish -f

button .hello -text "Hello World!"  -command "destroy ."
pack .hello<!--
      --></programlisting>
    </para>
    
    <para>
      That's it!  That's all there is to it.  If you have ever programmed X
      using a traditional toolkit such as Athena or Motif, you can
      appreciate how amazingly much more convenient this is.  If not, you
      can either take our word for it that this is 20 times less code than
      you would need to use a standard toolkit, or you can go write the
      same program in one of the usual toolkits and see for yourself...
    </para>
    
    <para>
      We cannot hope to provide a thorough introduction to Tk programming
      in this section.  Instead, we will just say that immensely complex
      applications can be constructed merely by programming in exactly the
      way shown in the above script.  By writing more complex scripts, and
      by utilizing the additional widgets provided by Tk, one can create
      beautiful, extensive user interfaces.  Moreover, this can be done in
      a tiny fraction of the time it takes to do the same work in a
      conventional toolkit.  Literally minutes versus days.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Tk provides widgets for labels, buttons, radio buttons, frames with
      or without borders, menubars, pull downs, toplevels, canvases, edit
      boxes, scroll bars, etc.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      A look at the interface provided by the PLplot Tk driver
      should help give you a better idea of what you can do with this
      paradigm.  Also check out some of the contributed Tcl/Tk packages
      available at harbor.  There are high quality Tk interfaces to a great
      many familiar Unix utilities ranging from mail to info, to SQL, to
      news, etc.  The list is endless and growing fast...
    </para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="introduction-itcl">
    <title>Introduction to [incr Tcl]</title>
    
    <para>
      Another extremely powerful and popular extension to Tcl is [incr
      Tcl].  [incr Tcl] is to Tcl what C++ is to C.  The analogy is very
      extensive.  Itcl provides an object oriented extension to Tcl
      supporting clustering of procedures and data into what is called an
      <literal>itcl_class</literal>.  An <literal>itcl_class</literal> can
      have methods as well as instance data.  And they support inheritance.
      Essentially if you know how C++ relates to C, and if you know Tcl,
      then you understand the programming model provided by Itcl.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      In particular, you can use Itcl to implement new widgets which are
      composed of more basic Tk widgets.  A file selector is an example.
      Using Tk, one can build up a very nice file selector comprised of
      more basic Tk widgets such as entries, listboxes, scrollbars, etc.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      But what if you need two file selectors?  You have to do it all
      again.  Or what if you need two different kinds of file selectors,
      you get to do it again and add some incremental code.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      This is exactly the sort of thing object orientation is intended to
      assist.  Using Itcl you can create an <literal>itcl_class
	FileSelector</literal> and then you can instantiate them freely as
      easily as:
    </para>
    
    <para>
      <programlisting>
    FileSelector .fs1
    .fs1 -dir . -find "*.cc"<!--
      --></programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      and so forth.
    </para>

    <para>
      These high level widgets composed of smaller Tk widgets, are known as
      <quote>megawidgets</quote>.  There is a developing subculture of the
      Tcl/Tk community for designing and implementing megawidgets, and
      [incr Tcl] is the most popular enabling technology.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      In particular, it is the enabling technology which is employed for
      the construction of the PLplot Tcl extensions, described below.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="extensions-tcl">
    <title>PLplot Extensions to Tcl</title>
    
    <para>
      Following the paradigm described above, PLplot provides extensions to
      Tcl as well, designed to allow the use of PLplot from Tcl/Tk
      programs.  Essentially the idea here is to allow PLplot programmers
      to achieve two goals:
    </para>
    
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  To access PLplot facilities from their own extended WISH and/or
	  Tcl/Tk user interface scripts.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  To have PLplot display its output in a window integrated
	  directly into the rest of their Tcl/Tk interface.
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    
    <para>
      For instance, prior to PLplot 5.0, if a programmer wanted to use
      PLplot in a Tcl/Tk application, the best he could manage was to call
      the PLplot C API from compiled C code, and get the output via the
      Xwin driver, which would display in it's own toplevel window.  In
      other words, there was no integration, and the result was pretty
      sloppy.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      With PLplot 5.0, there is now a supported Tcl interface to PLplot
      functionality.  This is provided through a <quote>family</quote> of
      PLplot megawidgets implemented in [incr Tcl].  Using this interface,
      a programmer can get a PLplot window/widget into a Tk interface as
      easily as:
    </para>

    <para>
      <programlisting>
PLWin .plw
pack .plw<!--
      --></programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
      Actually, there's the update/init business&mdash;need to clear that up.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The <literal>PLWin</literal> class then mirrors much of the PLplot C
      API, so that a user can generate plots in the PLplot widget entirely
      from Tcl.  This is demonstrated in the <filename>tk02</filename>
      demo,
    </para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 id="custom-extensions-tcl">
    <title>Custom Extensions to Tcl</title>
    
    <para>
      By this point, you should have a pretty decent understanding of the
      underlying philosophy of Tcl and Tk, and the whole concept of
      extensions, of which [incr Tcl] and PLplot are examples.  These alone
      are enough to allow the rapid prototyping and development of
      powerful, flexible graphical applications.  Normally the programmer
      simply writes a shell script to be executed by the Tk windowing
      shell, <command>wish</command>.  It is in vogue for each Tcl/Tk
      extension package to build it's own <quote>extended WISH</quote>.
      There are many examples of this, and indeed even PLplot's
      <command>plserver</command> program, described in an earlier chapter,
      could just as easily have been called <command>plwish</command>.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      In any event, as exciting and useful as these standalone, extended
      windowing shells may be, they are ultimately only the beginning of
      what you can do.  The real benefit of this approach is realized when
      you make your own <quote>extended WISH</quote>, comprised of Tcl, Tk,
      any of the standard extensions you like, and finally embellished with
      a smattering of application specific extensions designed to support
      your own application domain.  In this section we give a detailed
      introduction to the process of constructing your own WISH.  After
      that, you're on your own...
