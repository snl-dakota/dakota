  <title>Deploying programs that use PLplot</title>

  <para>
    This chapter provides some information on the issue of
    delivering programs that use PLplot: what files should be installed and
    where, what environment variables are involved and related matters.
  </para>

  <para>
    The scenario is this: You have created one or more programs that run
    successfully on your development machine and now you need to install
    them on the machine of a user.
  </para>

  <para>
    One solution is to provide him or her with the full development
    environment that you use, but that is in general only an option if your
    user is comfortable with making programs themselves. A more common
    situation is that your user just wants the executable programs and
    wants to get using them rightaway. We will focus on this particular
    solution, as there are a few non-trivial issues.
  </para>

  <para>
    To be absolutely clear about what we are describing, here is a summary:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Your program must run on a machine that does not have PLplot
          installed from the sources.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          There is no development environment that you can rely on.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The program should be installed in a self-contained directory
          structure (which <emphasis>can</emphasis> be
          <filename>/usr/local</filename> or <filename>c:\program</filename>
          files or whatever, but need not be so).
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
    Under Linux, the easiest way to install a binary version of PLplot on a
    user's machine is to use PLplot deb binary packages for the <ulink
    url="http://www.debian.org">Debian</ulink> distribution, and PLplot rpm
    binary packages for rpm-based distributions. (See the <ulink
    url="http://plplot.sourceforge.net/resources/index.html">Resources
    area</ulink> of the PLplot web site for locations of debs and rpms.)
    Build the application on the build machine using the results of the
    <userinput>plplot-config --cflags --libs</userinput> command, and copy
    the resulting executable(s) to the users' machines.
  </para>

  <para>
    Under Unix (and also under Linux if you would prefer to use a newer
    version of PLplot than is available in the debs or rpms), a good way
    to deploy binary PLplot and applications that depend on that binary PLplot
    on users' machines is as follows:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
	  Use the <command>./configure</command> option
	  <userinput>--prefix=/usr/local/plplot</userinput> (or some other
	  unique but consistent directory that is available on the build
	  machine and all users' machines).
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
	  Build and install as normal on the build machine.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
	  Copy the installed PLplot tree,
	  <filename>/usr/local/plplot</filename>, into a tarball.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
	  Unpack that tarball on all users' machines in the same location
	  <filename>/usr/local/plplot</filename>.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
	  Build the application(s) on the build machine using the results
	  of the <userinput>plplot-config --cflags --libs</userinput>
	  command, and copy the resulting executable(s) to the users'
	  machines.  Since the PLplot install location is consistent on all
	  machines, the application should work the same way on all
	  machines.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
    On Windows, and also those rare Linux/Unix cases where you cannot install
    the PLplot install tree in a consistent location on users' machines, then
    there are some additional options you need to consider.
  </para>

  <para>
    There are three situations depending on how you configure and
    build the PLplot libraries:
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          You use the static versions of the PLplot libraries and devices
	  which are not dynamically loaded.
          <footnote>
            <para>
              UNIX-like systems libraries can be static or shared, the first
              type becoming part of the program, the second existing as a
              separate file. On Windows the terms are respectively static
              and dynamic (the latter type is also known as DLL).
            </para>
          </footnote>
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          You use the shared versions of the PLplot libraries and devices
	  which are not dynamically loaded.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          You use the shared versions of the PLplot library and devices
	  which are dynamically loaded.  This combination is the default
	  option under Unix/Linux.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
    In the <emphasis>first</emphasis> case the program will contain all the
    code it needs to work, but to run successfully, it needs to find the
    font files, <filename>plstnd5.fnt</filename> and
    <filename>plxtnd5.fnt</filename>. The mechanism used in PLplot to find
    these files is fairly simple:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          It looks at a number of built-in places, determined at the time
          the PLplot library itself was installed and built. For deployment
          these places are irrelevant in general.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          It looks at the environment variables
          <envar>PLPLOT_LIB</envar> and <envar>PLPLOT_HOME</envar>.
          (Actually, this happens only, if the corresponding compiler
          macros <envar>PLPLOT_LIB_ENV</envar> and
          <envar>PLPLOT_HOME_ENV</envar> were defined at compile time.)
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis>(TODO: remark about Mac)</emphasis>
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
    Note: This is also the place to put the geographical map files, if you
    happen to use them.
  </para>

  <para>
    The environment variables should point to the directory holding the two
    font files or the one above (one variable is enough though):
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <envar>PLPLOT_LIB</envar> should point to the directory
          actually holding these files
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <envar>PLPLOT_HOME</envar> should point to the directory that
          holds a subdirectory <quote><filename>lib</filename></quote>
          which in turn holds these files.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
    If it can find these, PLplot can do its job.
  </para>

  <para>
    Note: This is the case for instance when you use the static PLplot
    library on Windows (see the directory
    <filename>sys\win32\msdev\plplib</filename>).
  </para>

  <para>
    In the <emphasis>second </emphasis> case the font and map files are found
    as in the <emphasis>first</emphasis> case.  In addition, you also
    require another environment variable so the PLplot shared libraries can
    be found at run time by the run-time loader.  The details depend on the
    system you are working on, but here are some common platforms:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Most UNIX, BSD and Linux systems use an environment variable
          <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar> which indicates 
          directories where shared libraries can be found. Some use
          <envar>SHLIB_PATH</envar>, like HPUX.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          On Windows the PATH variable is used to find the DLLs, but
          beware: Windows uses a number of places to find the DLLs a
          program needs and the ordering seems to depend on some intricate
          details. It seems easiest and safest to put the DLLs in the same
          directory as your program.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          On MacOSX, ... <emphasis>TODO</emphasis>
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
    In the <emphasis>third</emphasis> (default) case, the PLplot fonts and
    maps are found as in the <emphasis>first</emphasis> case, and the 
    shared libraries are found as in the <emphasis>second</emphasis> case,
    but in addition the separated dynamic devices have to be found as well.
  </para>

  <para>
    When PLplot uses dynamic devices, it first builds up a list of them, by
    examining a directory which contains files describing those devices:
    the <filename>*.rc</filename> files. Each of these files indicates what
    the relevant properties for the device or devices. Then when the
    device is actually needed, the corresponding shared object (or plug-in
    or DLL depending on your terminology) is dynamically loaded.
  </para>

  <para>
    The directory that contains all these files (the device descriptions as
    well as the actual libraries and the description files that libtool
    uses) is a directory determined at the time you configured
    PLplot which is typically something like
    <filename>/usr/local/plplot/lib/plplot5.3.1/driversd</filename>.  This
    directory must be pointed to by the <envar>PLPLOT_DRV_DIR</envar>
    environment variable. Again for deployment, only the environment
    variable is of real interest.
  </para>

  <para>
    To summarise the case where you don't have a deb or rpm option, and
    you must use inconsistent install locations on your users' machines:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The following environment variables are important:
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                <envar>PLPLOT_HOME</envar> or
                <envar>PLPLOT_LIB</envar> to indicate the position of
                font files (and also of the various geographic maps)
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar>,
                <envar>SHLIB_PATH</envar> or <envar>PATH</envar> to
                find the dynamic/shared libraries
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                <envar>PLPLOT_DRV_DIR</envar> to find the device
                descriptions
              </para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The following files being part of PLplot must be distributed
          along with your program:
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                The font files (<filename>plstnd5.fnt</filename> and
                <filename>plxtnd5.fnt</filename>) and, possibly, if you use
                them, the geographic map files.
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                The PLplot shared libraries
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>
                The device description files and the device shared object files
              </para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
    All the environment variables, except
    <envar>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</envar> and equivalents, can be set within
    the program (by using a small configuration file or by determining the
    position of the files relative to the program's location). They just
    have be set before PLplot is initialised.
