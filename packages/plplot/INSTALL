PLplot Installation Notes
=========================

For non Unix-based systems, refer to the notes in sys/<system name>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General instructions for Unix-based systems
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(For specific Unix instructions see below.)

PLplot building and installation is trivially easy on most Unix systems.
From the distribution directory, type:

./configure --prefix=MYPREFIX
make
make install
# Important, for the remainder to work, MYPREFIX/bin must be on your path.
cd MYPREFIX/share/plplotVERSION/examples
make
./plplot-test.sh

MYPREFIX stands symbolically for the installation prefix.  That could be
/usr/local/plplot, but that requires root account access to use that system
location.  Another alternative is some convenient location under your home
account such as $HOME/local/plplot where you have write access under your
ordinary user account.

VERSION stands symbolically for the version.  Currently, that is 5.5.1, but
it will change.

IMPORTANT.  In prior versions we only supported the Gnu form of the make
command, but thanks to autotools the native form of the make command is now
supported.

To find out all options available for configure type
./configure --help |less

We also support a wide variety of environment variables to help the
configuration system find software that has been installed in non-standard
places.  Eventually, all those environment variables will be replaced by
documented configuration options, but for now see the code in sysloc.in to
see what environment variables can be set prior to running ./configure, e.g., 

JAVAMDINCDIR
GDINCDIR
CDINCDIR
FREETYPEINCDIR
TCLINCDIR
ITCLINCDIR
TKINCDIR
TKPRIVATEINCDIR
TCLPRIVATEINCDIR
PYTHON_INC_DIR

GDLIBDIR
PNGLIBDIR
JPEGLIBDIR
ZLIBLIBDIR
CDLIBDIR
FREETYPELIBDIR
TCLLIBDIR
ITCLLIBDIR
TKLIBDIR
ITKLIBDIR
VGALIBDIR

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile your own programs, there are two ways possible:


1) Use "plplot-config", eg:

   cc  myprog.c -o myprog  `plplot-config --cflags --libs`
   c++  myprog.cc -o myprog  `plplot-config --cflags --libs --with-c++`
   f77  myprog.c -o myprog  `plplot-config --cflags --libs --with-f77`
   cc  myprog.c -o myprog  `plplot-config --cflags --libs --with-tcl`

   The last variation of the cc command is required if you are building your
   own extended wish as in examples/tk/xtk??.c where you need to mention the
   tcl/tk headers for the compile step and libplplottcltk for the link step.


2) Use the pkg-config support, eg:

       cc myprog.c -o myprog `pkg-config --cflags --libs <package>`

   where <package> is either "plplot" (for single precision) or "plplotd"
   (for double precision).  For C++, Fortran 77, and Tcl/Tk programs,
   <package> should be respectively plplot-c++, plplot-f77, and plplot-tcl
   (for single precision), or plplotd-c++, plplotd-f77, amd plplotd-tcl (for
   double precision).

   For getting the PLplot configuration flags in autoconf scripts, use the
   PKG_CHECK_MODULES macro distributed with pkg-config (usually in
   /usr/share/aclocal/pkg.m4) like this:

       PKG_CHECK_MODULES(PLPLOT, plplotd >= 5.3)

   and the variables PLPLOT_CFLAGS and PLPLOT_LIBS will be set.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build Instructions for Cygwin (from information supplied by U.D.Kini)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Platform: i686-pc-cygwin

Cygwin (1.5.5)
gcc (3.3.1)
Windows 98 2nd Edition
Pentium 3 Processor

Must disable everything Tcl/Tk related because the Cygwin Tcl/Tk packages
are only for the windows subset of the full Unix version, and our tcl
interface needs the full Unix version.

Must disable qhull and cgm because both Cygwin packages only have the
static version of the libraries, and autotools on Cygwin does not work
for mixed static and shared libraries.

Must disable dyndrivers because of multiple segfaults when running the
examples.  It appears that dynamic loading of shared objects (such as our
dynamic devices) is not quite ready for prime time for Cygwin.

Must disable the xterm device because the Cygwin version of the xterm
application that comes with XFree86 has trouble switching between the xterm
plot windown and the ordinary command-line window for the xterm application.
However, the xterm device is disabled by default in any case since you would
only use it as last resort (monochrome, rather lame software fill) so no
need to be explicit.

./configure --prefix=$MYPREFIX --disable-tcl --without-qhull --disable-cgm \
--disable-dyndrivers

make

Simple Cygwin g77 test programmes indicate iargc works fine, but
nevertheless for our configurable.f which is linked as part of libplplotf77
iargc always returns -1 for the number of arguments regardless of the actual
number so fortran command-line parsing fails.  We assume this problem is 
caused by some sort of linking problem and maturation of Cygwin and/or
libtool will fix it. Meanwhile to work-around this problem do the following:

edit test/test_f77.sh and change line from

if test "yes" = "yes"; then

to

if test "yes" != "yes"; then

The remainder of the check, install, and test of installed examples should
go as normal.

make check

make install

cd MYPREFIX/share/plplotVERSION/examples

make

Finally, run 

./plplot-test.sh

(which invokes test_f77.sh and other test scripts) to generate a rather
complete set of postscript examples for the available language interfaces.
Use

./plplot-test.sh --help

for instructions on testing additional file devices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build Instructions for Mingw
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Platform: i686-pc-mingw32

Mingw (2.0) + MSYS (1.1.10)
gcc (3.2)
Windows XP SP1
Athlon XP Processor


You must install Msys as well as Mingw in order to build plplot under Mingw. 
If you want to rebuild from CVS, you will also need MsysDTK as well.

The library must be built with "--disable-shared".

Under Mingw & Msys, simply use "configure --disable-shared" then 
"make install" to build.

The Mingw display driver is called "wingcc". As a driver, it is still under 
development and is only in its infancy. The driver has two driver specific 
options if plplot was compiled with freetype support: "text" and "smooth". 
"-drvopt text,smooth", as with the GD drivers, makes the driver use freetype 
to render text, rather than plplot's hershey fonts.

My instructions are based on the installation through fink, which is
what I recommend :)

Here are the settings I use for fink (where /sw is the prefix - if
people don't want to use fink, they need to adjust the paths in
configure to wherever the corresponding files are located):


export CFLAGS=-Wno-long-double
export FLIBS='-L/sw/lib -lfrtbegin -lSystem'

./configure --mandir=/sw/share/man FREETYPELIBDIR=/usr/X11R6/lib
FREETYPEINCDIR=/usr/X11R6/include/freetype2 TCLLIBDIR=/sw/lib
TKLIBDIR=/sw/lib GDLIBDIR=/sw/lib
JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.4.1/Home
--with-pthreads --with-pkg-config

make
make install

There is no need on my system to use that flag.

[ N.B.: some users reported that the --with-pthreads option cause problems
  with interactive demos, like using the mouse with the xwin driver.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build Instructions for Solaris (as of plplot-5.3.0.cvs.20040217.tar.gz)
N.B. with this version FLIBS is no longer required!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Platform (uname -a): SunOS sparc-solaris1 5.9 Generic_112233-03 sun4u sparc SUNW,Ultra-60

* Development environment: native cc, f95, and ld.

* Environment variables that should be set _before_ ./configure is run:

  + export MYPREFIX=/whatever

  + export PATH="/opt/SUNWspro/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:"$PATH":$MYPREFIX/bin"

    /opt/SUNWspro/bin puts native cc and f95 on the path, /usr/ccs/bin puts
    native ld on the path, and $MYPREFIX/bin is there for when you want to
    execute some of those PLplot executables or scripts you have just
    installed.

  + export CC=cc

    Identify the native C compiler for ./configure

  + export F77=f95

    Identify the native fortran compiler for ./configure

    Note, there is also a f77 script that invokes the f95 compiler with
    certain options.  But use of F77=f77 confused libtool, and it was better
    to use F77=f95 directly (with no special options).  This means our
    fortran code (interface and examples) is reasonably standards compliant
    because it all compiled under the native solaris f95 compiler with no
    special flags. Note, fortran command-line parsing worked on solaris so
    we are now three for three (g77, OSF1 f77, and solaris f95) on that
    score.

* Remaining commands to configure, build, and install:

  + ./configure --prefix=$MYPREFIX --disable-cxx --without-gnu-ld

    --disable-cxx is required since native C++ is not available on this
    system (while g++ is, and that may confuse issues unless you turn it
    off).  --without-gnu-ld is required so the native linker, /usr/ccs/bin
    is used rather than the Gnu linker in /usr/local/bin/ld.  Note this is a
    "bare bones" sparcbox so absolutely nothing is available for development
    natively other than the cc C compiler, the g95 fortran compiler, and the
    ld linker.

  + make
  
  + make check

  + make install

Here is the configuration summary:

command:        ./configure --prefix=/home/users/a/ai/airwin/plplot_install_solaris_sparc --disable-cxx --without-gnu-ld
system:         sparc-sun-solaris2.9
have_x:         yes
prefix:         /home/users/a/ai/airwin/plplot_install_solaris_sparc
CC:             cc 
F77:            f95 
LIB_TAG:        d
devices:         hp7470 hp7580 lj_hpgl mem null pbm plmeta ps psc pstex xfig xwin

Available device drivers:
static:         
dynamic:         hpgl.la mem.la null.la pbm.la plmeta.la ps.la pstex.la xfig.la xwin.la

Compilation options:
with_debug:     no              with_opt:       yes
with_warn:      no              with_profile:   no

Library options:
enable_shared:  yes             enable_static:  yes
with_rpath:     yes             with_double:    yes

Optional libraries:
with_qhull:     no              with_csa:       yes
with_freetype:  no              with_pthreads:  no


Language Bindings:
enable_tcl:     no              enable_itcl:    no
enable_cxx:     no              enable_f77:     yes
enable_java:    no              enable_python:  no
enable_octave:  no

As you can see a fair number of devices got built, although the only ones
really useful on a remote machine like this without X client access are the
psc, ps, and plmeta devices. make, make check (which builds 34 postscript
files in the build tree), and make install proceeded without errors. After I
installed (to a non-root MYPREFIX that was under my control as an ordinary
user) I did the usual install tree test as well:

cd MYPREFIX/share/plplotVERSION/examples; make; ./plplot-test.sh

and 34 postscript figures were produced.  Roughly half were identical with
Linux-produced figures, and the other half were only slightly distinguishable
visually (slight changes in the rendering of some of the characters).
Presumably these differences are due to our current 16-bit rendering.

In sum, it was a good result for plplot-5.3.0.cvs.20040217.tar.gz and it
should also be a good native (cc, f95, and ld) solaris result for
PLplot-5.3.1 (when that official release is completed).  

Adjust these instructions if you want to use the Gnu versions of everything
(which allows you to use g++). 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build Instructions for IRIX (as of plplot-5.3.0.cvs.20040217.tar.gz)
N.B. with this version FLIBS is no longer required!
(Note by Arjen Markus)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Platform (uname -a): IRIX64 (machinename removed) 6.5 04101930 IP27

* Development environment: native cc, f90, and ld.

* Environment variables that should be set _before_ ./configure is run:

  + export PATH=/wherever the compilers are located:"$PATH"

    On the system that I used the cc and f90 were available via /usr/local/bin,
    this may or may not be a typical situation.

  + export CC=cc

    Identify the native C compiler for ./configure

  + export F77=f90

    Identify the native fortran compiler for ./configure

* Remaining commands to configure, build, and install:

  + ./configure --prefix=$MYPREFIX --without-gnu-ld CXXFLAGS=-LANG:std -disable-cxx --disable-tk --disable-tkwin

    Notes on the various flags:
    - CXXFLAGS is needed because the C++ compiler complained about the
      lines "use namespace std" and suggested this option to be added.
    - --disable-cxx was required nonetheless because the examples would
      not compile.
    - --disable-tk and --disable-tkwin were necessary, because the 
      installation of Tcl/Tk was incomplete (change of directory structure)

  + make
  
  + make check

    This produced almost identical PostScript files for the C and F77
    examples.

  + make install 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build Instructions for AIX5.2 (as of the forthcoming plplot-5.5.2 since
there was one ./configure script problem for plplot-5.5.1 that has just
been fixed in CVS).
(This report compiled by Alan W. Irwin on 2005-04-12
from e-mail sent by Simon Pinches)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Platform AIX 5.2

* Development environment: gcc

* Environment variables that should be set _before_ ./configure is run: None

Simon found a ./configure issue for plplot-5.5.1 which has since been fixed
in CVS.  He also found that dynamic devices and shared libraries did not
work for AIX5.2.  This is probably a libtool problem, and it will be worth
checking this again every year or so to see if this libtool problem has been
fixed.

When Simon used the fix in CVS (which should be released in the
forthcoming plplot-5.5.2) and used

./configure --prefix=MYPREFIX --disable-shared --enable-static

followed by the remainder of the generic install instructions at the top of
this file, then he got good results.  Note, the --disable-shared option also
automatically invokes the --disable-dyndrivers option internally.
