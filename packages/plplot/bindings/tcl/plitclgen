# This script is used to automatically generate the [incr Tcl] methods
# needed in the PLWin [incr Tcl] class.  These methods mirror most of
# the Tcl API commands which are generated by the companion script,
# pltclgen. 
#
# However, PLWin is a widget wrapper, and as such, not all of the Tcl
# API has any business being in the widget.  So we remove various
# shadow methods for portions of the API which are not relevant to
# widgets, such as the stream manipulation functions, etc.
#
# Also, note that this script is not quite as automatic as pltclgen.
# The output must be inserted by hand into PLWin.tcl.  Hopefully this
# will not seem like an unreasonable limitation, since the Tcl API
# only changes occasionally by this point.
