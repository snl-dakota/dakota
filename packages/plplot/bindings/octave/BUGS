There must be more... see ToDo, they are mostly there

0-There is no support for NaNs or Infs

1-There are problems when plotting negative values with logaritm axis.

  A partial fix is provided in 0.3.1. However, the plot line is split into
  several lines.

2-This is not a bug, but a PLplot feature: there is no autoscale, as
  in gnuplot. This means that, after the first plot, after executing hold(),
  further plotting will be clipped to the viewport defined by the first plot.
  IT IS possible to redefine the viewport, but the previous plots will not 
  be redrawn to the new viewport. Also, one would have to erase the previous
  frame box and draw a new one.

4-`ginput' lets the cross-hair drawn in the plot. Don't know how to avoid it.
  Issue 'plflush' at the command line as a remedy.

5-bottom_title and top_title can't be used.
